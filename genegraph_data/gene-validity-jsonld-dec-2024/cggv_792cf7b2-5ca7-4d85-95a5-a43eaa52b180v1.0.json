Despite playing a critical role in development, the expression of myosin Va in the central nervous system throughout the human life span has not been reported.

Myosin Va was expressed at all ages from the 10th postnatal day to the 98 th year of life, in molecular, Purkinje and granular cerebellar layers. Cerebellar myosin Va expression did not differ essentially in localization or intensity from childhood to old age, except during the postnatal developmental period. Structures resembling granules and climbing fibers in Purkinje cells were deeply stained. In dentate neurons, long processes were deeply stained by anti-myosin Va, as were punctate nuclear structures. During the first postnatal year, myosin Va was differentially expressed in the external granular layer (EGL). In the EGL, proliferating prospective granule cells were not stained by anti-myosin Va antibody. In contrast, premigratory granule cells in the EGL stained moderately. Granule cells exhibiting a migratory profile in the molecular layer were also moderately stained.

Here we sought to define the role that myosin Va plays in melanosome transport and distribution. Actin filaments that comprise a cortical shell running the length of the dendrite were found to exhibit a random orientation, suggesting that myosin Va could drive the outward spreading of melanosomes by catalyzing random walks. In contrast to this mechanism, time lapse video microscopy revealed that melanosomes undergo rapid ( approximately 1.5 microm/s) microtubule-dependent movements to the periphery and back again. This bidirectional traffic occurs in both wild-type and dilute melanocytes, but it is more obvious in dilute melanocytes because the only melanosomes in their periphery are those undergoing this movement. While providing an efficient means to transport melanosomes to the periphery, this component does not by itself result in their net accumulation there. These observations, together with previous studies showing extensive colocalization of myosin Va and melanosomes in the actin-rich periphery, suggest a mechanism in which a myosin Va-dependent interaction of melanosomes with F-actin in the periphery prevents these organelles from returning on microtubules to the cell center, causing their distal accumulation. This \"capture\" model is supported by the demonstration that (a) expression of the myosin Va tail domain within wild-type cells creates a dilute-like phenotype via a process involving initial colocalization of tail domains with melanosomes in the periphery, followed by an approximately 120-min, microtubule-based redistribution of melanosomes to the cell center; (b) microtubule-dependent melanosome movement appears to be damped by myosin Va; (c) intermittent, microtubule-independent, approximately 0.14 microm/s melanosome movements are seen only in wild-type melanocytes; and (d) these movements do not drive obvious spreading of melanosomes over 90 min. We conclude that long-range, bidirectional, microtubule-dependent melanosome movements, coupled with actomyosin Va-dependent capture of melanosomes in the periphery, is the predominant mechanism responsible for the centrifugal transport and peripheral accumulation of melanosomes in mouse melanocytes. This mechanism represents an alternative to straightforward transport models when interpreting other myosin V mutant phenotypes.","dc:creator":"Wu X","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Visualization of melanosome dynamics within wild-type and dilute melanocytes suggests a paradigm for myosin V function In vivo."},"rdfs:label":"Colocalization of  myosin Va tail domains and melanosome"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:792cf7b2-5ca7-4d85-95a5-a43eaa52b180_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b77c360b-391c-46c4-b036-e03f11f60b30","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:85ed8fc2-738f-43c0-9f3c-f34a8aa05f18","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against the exon F-containing isoforms of MyoVa (exon-specific RNAi (RNA interference)) was developed and transfected into primary human epidermal melanocytes.

The pigmentary dilution is characterized by a diffuse skin pigmentation, silvery hair, large clumps of pigments in the hair shafts (Fig. 1) and an accumulation of melanosomes in melanocytes, with abnormal transfer of the melanin granules to the keratinocytes. Immunological abnormalities are characterized by absent delayed-type cutaneous hypersensitivity and an impaired natural-killer cell function. A similar disorder has been described in the dilute lethal mouse--which, however, differs by the occurrence of a severe neurological disorder. The dilute locus encodes myosin-Va, a member of the unconventional myosin family. Myosins bind actin and produce mechanical force through ATP hydrolysis. Some members of this family are thought to participate in organelle-transport machinery. Because of the phenotype resulting in the dilute mouse and because of their potential role in intracellular transport, unconventional myosin-encoding genes were regarded as candidate genes for Griscelli disease. Here we report that the Griscelli disease locus co-localizes on chromosome 15q21 with the myosin-Va gene, MYO5a, and that mutations of this gene occur in two patients with the disease.

Myosin Va is a processive molecular motor that is described to be responsible for the actin-dependent transport of different types of organelles. The protein encoded by this gene is abundant in melanocytes and nerve cells. Mutations in MYO5A gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Griscelli syndrome, type 1 (GS1) in 1997 (Pastural et al., PMID: 9207796). GS1 represents hypomelanosis with a primary neurologic deficit and without immunologic impairment. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included six unique variants (4 nonsense, 1 frameshift, 1 intragenic deletion) reported in six unrelated probands in five publications (PMID 9207796, Pastural et al., 2000, PMID: 10704277, Menasche et al., 2003, PMID: 12897212, Thomas et al., 2009, PMID: 19318926, Abd Elmaksoud et al. 2020, PMID 32275080). The gene-disease association is supported by myosin Va biochemical function (Wu et al., 1998), MYO5A expression in human skin cells (Lambert et al., 1998, PMID 9826529) and human cerebellum (Souza et al., 2013, PMID 23558932), functional alteration of MYO5A in human epidermal melanocytes (Van Gele et al., 2008, PMID: 18401430), and mouse models that reproduce part of the human phenotype (Provance et al. 1996, PMID 8962090, Takagishi et al. 2006, PMID 1718550). In summary, MYO5A is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Griscelli syndrome type 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 26Jan2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:792cf7b2-5ca7-4d85-95a5-a43eaa52b180"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
