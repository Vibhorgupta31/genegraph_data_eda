We have sequenced 2,396 index patients using the ThromboGenomics HTS panel test of diagnostic-grade genes known to harbour variants associated with rare bleeding, thrombotic or platelet disorders (BTPD).

The MDT classified 745 unique variants, including copy number and intronic variants, as Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic or Variants of Uncertain Significance. Half (50.9%) of these variants are novel and 41 unique variants were identified in 7 genes recently found to be implicated in BTPD.

The complex is known to contain the coiled-coil-forming proteins, Pallidin, Muted, Cappuccino, and Dysbindin. The genes encoding these proteins are defective in inbred mouse strains that serve as models of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), a genetic disorder characterized by hypopigmentation and platelet storage pool deficiency. In addition, mutation of human Dysbindin causes HPS type 7. Here, we report the identification of another four subunits of the complex. One is Snapin, a coiled-coil-forming protein previously characterized as a binding partner of synaptosomal-associated proteins 25 and 23 and implicated in the regulation of membrane fusion events. The other three are previously uncharacterized proteins, which we named BLOC subunits 1, 2, and 3 (BLOS1, -2, and -3). Using specific antibodies to detect endogenous proteins from human and mouse cells, we found that Snapin, BLOS1, BLOS2, and BLOS3 co-immunoprecipitate, and co-fractionate upon size exclusion chromatography, with previously known BLOC-1 subunits. Furthermore, steady-state levels of the four proteins are significantly reduced in cells from pallid mice, which carry a mutation in Pallidin and display secondary loss of other BLOC-1 subunits. Yeast two-hybrid analyses suggest a network of binary interactions involving all of the previously known and newly identified subunits. Interestingly, the HPS mouse model strain, reduced pigmentation, carries a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding BLOS3. As judged from size exclusion chromatographic analyses, the reduced pigmentation mutation affects BLOC-1 assembly less severely than the pallid mutation. Mutations in the human genes encoding Snapin and the BLOS proteins could underlie novel forms of HPS.","dc:creator":"Starcevic M","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Identification of snapin and three novel proteins (BLOS1, BLOS2, and BLOS3/reduced pigmentation) as subunits of biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1)."},"rdfs:label":"Starcevic_PI1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Pallidin (BLOC1S6) and Dysbindin (DTNBP1) are also implicated in HPS subtype 9 and 7, respectively."},{"id":"cggv:6511b148-919c-4104-8c8f-b6a4fdc1d036","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b23f919f-42d9-4223-b9f4-d01d05a45372","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"BLOC-1 protein was immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled HeLa cells using antibodies to Pallidin, Dysbindin BLOC1S2 or BLOC1S3.

Seven genes cause HPS in humans (HPS1-HPS7) and at least 15 nonallelic mutations cause HPS in mice. Where their function is known, the HPS proteins participate in protein trafficking and vesicle docking/fusion events during organelle biogenesis. HPS-associated genes participate in at least 4 distinct protein complexes: the adaptor complex AP-3; biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1), consisting of 4 HPS proteins (pallidin, muted, cappuccino, HPS7/sandy); BLOC-2, consisting of HPS6/ruby-eye, HPS5/ruby-eye-2, and HPS3/cocoa; and BLOC-3, consisting of HPS1/pale ear and HPS4/light ear. Here, we report the cloning of the mouse HPS mutation reduced pigmentation (rp). We show that the wild-type rp gene encodes a novel, widely expressed 195-amino acid protein that shares 87% amino acid identity with its human orthologue and localizes to punctate cytoplasmic structures. Further, we show that phosphorylated RP is part of the BLOC-1 complex. In mutant rp/rp mice, a premature stop codon truncates the protein after 79 amino acids.

Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 8 is a subtype of HPS, characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis and platelet dysfunction. *BLOC1S3* encodes subunit 3 of the Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complex 1, BLOC-1, which is required for normal biogenesis of specialized organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system, such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules (PMID: 15102850). Of the 8 subunits of BLOC-1, mutations in three, including *BLOC1S3*, are reported in association with HPS subtypes in humans (Huizing et al., Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome, GeneReviews). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (5.9 points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 16385460, 22709368, 31064749, 32687635). The variant was found to cosegregate with disease in 5 additional individuals in 1 family (PMID: 16385460).    \nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function. The BLOC1S3 is a two exon gene with essentially 1 coding exon. Truncated transcripts are not expected to undergo NMD; however, the one published report predicts boundary-independent NMD (PMID: 22709368). \n  \nSummary of Experimental Data (4 points): \nThis gene-disease association is supported by studies of protein interaction with other subunits of BLOC-1(PMID: 15102850), functional alteration of melansome maturation (PMID: 22709368), and by the spontaneously occurring mouse mutation, “reduced pigmentation” or rp that recapitulates the HPS phenotype (PMID: 15265785). \n  \nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the HT GCEP on 09/23/2020. It was reevaluated on 09/28/2022. As a result of this reevaluation no new evidence was identified and the classification remained at Moderate (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bdeec503-f903-4507-89e7-33c9255b5ad1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
