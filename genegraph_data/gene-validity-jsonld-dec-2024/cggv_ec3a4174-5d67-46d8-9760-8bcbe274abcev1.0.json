Here we show that IL-10 sensing by innate immune cells, independent of its effects on T cells, was critical for regulating mucosal homeostasis. Following wild-type (WT) CD4(+) T cell transfer, Rag2(-/-)Il10rb(-/-) mice developed severe colitis in association with profound defects in generation and function of Treg cells. Moreover, loss of IL-10R signaling impaired the generation and function of anti-inflammatory intestinal and bone-marrow-derived macrophages and their ability to secrete IL-10. Importantly, transfer of WT but not Il10rb(-/-) anti-inflammatory macrophages ameliorated colitis induction by WT CD4(+) T cells in Rag2(-/-)Il10rb(-/-) mice. Similar alterations in the generation and function of anti-inflammatory macrophages were observed in IL-10R-deficient patients with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Collectively, our studies define innate immune IL-10R signaling as a key factor regulating mucosal immune homeostasis in mice and humans.","dc:creator":"Shouval DS","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Interleukin-10 receptor signaling in innate immune cells regulates mucosal immune tolerance and anti-inflammatory macrophage function."},"rdfs:label":"IL10, IL10RA, IL10RB have same effects"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ec3a4174-5d67-46d8-9760-8bcbe274abce_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd134e8e-8ebd-4bd2-ad05-b72153cb5587","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5fbf6ebe-93f7-4506-a692-57c8c0fe4f60","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"coexpression of mutant IL10R1 G141R and wild-type IL10R2 did not result in STAT3 phosphorylation on exposure to interleukin-10 (Fig. 3I)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19890111","rdfs:label":"Retroviral expression of IL10R1 and IL10R2 in HeLa cells."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4a9bcefb-098d-4d96-873a-e8b04739c797","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:690815cb-81ef-4829-8344-b3e20a156804","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"protein array analysis to measure supernatants of LPS stimulated PBMCs.

IL10Rα is the ligand binding subunit of the IL10R receptor complex in hematopoietic cells. L10 signaling functions as an anti-inflammatory pathway that can inhibit proinflammatory responses of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Inflammatory bowel disease 28, early onset, autosomal recessive (MONDO: 0013153) presents as very onset IBD. A total of 22 variants, including nonsense and missense, have been reported in 11 patients in \n4 publications (PMID: 19890111, 25373860, 23158016, 28267044).  Variants were found to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, variants segregate with disease, and the disease mechanism is suggested to be loss of function. Experimental evidence includes reduction of IL10RB expression and IL10 signaling in the patients’ cells and loss of Il-10 response in LPS stimulated PBMCs. Cells carrying the IL10RA G141R mutation secreted increased levels of TNF- α; TGF-β1; interleukin-1 α, -1β, -2, and -6; soluble receptor of interleukin-6. IL10R−/− mice. Animals develop a disease that appears largely to depend upon an inappropriate immune response to intestinal antigens, and recapitulate human disease. Reports included in the curation span the time period from 2009 until present, therefore the classification is definitive. \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ec3a4174-5d67-46d8-9760-8bcbe274abce"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
