It is a rare autosomal recessive mitochondrial disorder with multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions and/or depletion. It is caused by thymidine phosphorylase (TP) gene mutations resulting in a complete abolition of TP activity. We tested 31 unrelated patients presenting either with a complete MNGIE syndrome (8 patients), a severe intestinal pseudo-obstruction (10 patients), and multiple deletions and/or depletion of mitochondrial DNA (13 patients). All the tested patients presenting with a complete MNGIE had increased thymidine levels in plasma and urine, and no TP activity. The group with pseudo-obstruction syndrome had normal or partial reduction of TP activity. We found pathogenic mutations on TP gene only in the MNGIE syndrome group: all the MNGIE patients were compound heterozygous or homozygous for mutations in the TP gene. Eight of these mutations are yet unreported, confirming the lack of genotype/phenotype correlation in this syndrome. Enzymatic activity and thymidine level are thus rapid diagnosis tests to detect MNGIE affected patients prior to genetic testing for patients with gastrointestinal symptoms.","dc:creator":"Slama A","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Thymidine phosphorylase gene mutations in patients with mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy syndrome."}},{"id":"cggv:2ebc762e-6346-48c0-a671-4a8f6db86916_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:810ef5ec-e649-4266-b000-14ec57988e24"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15781193"}],"rdfs:label":"Slama 2005 patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:2ebc762e-6346-48c0-a671-4a8f6db86916","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2ebc762e-6346-48c0-a671-4a8f6db86916_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:2ebc762e-6346-48c0-a671-4a8f6db86916_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"well conserved"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"0.1 (other)\n+0.2 (mtDNA deletions)\n+0.2 (TP deficiency)"},{"id":"cggv:ad5bb7cc-59b5-4dfa-be7d-62c8e7518e2f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad5bb7cc-59b5-4dfa-be7d-62c8e7518e2f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ad5bb7cc-59b5-4dfa-be7d-62c8e7518e2f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"Located in thymidine/pyrimidine nucleoside consensus site\n"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"0.1 (other)\n+0.2 (mtDNA deletions)\n+0.2 (TP deficiency)\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:730b9c5f-7cc4-4cc0-bd78-ecc8fd9f8c08_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:730b9c5f-7cc4-4cc0-bd78-ecc8fd9f8c08","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:3afbbc36-7dbd-42d6-a4be-2e7a7bddc952","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001953.5(TYMP):c.433G>A (p.Gly145Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA126763"}},"detectionMethod":"Sequencing of TYMP exons 2-10 after linkage to 22q13.32-qter in families 1-4\n","firstTestingMethod":"Other","phenotypeFreeText":"Drastically reduced TP activity in leukocytes\n","previousTesting":false,"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:8db0e594-a9b4-4fb2-8222-0cec8be522ce_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3afbbc36-7dbd-42d6-a4be-2e7a7bddc952"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9924029","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is an autosomal recessive human disease associated with multiple deletions of skeletal muscle mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which have been ascribed to a defect in communication between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.

Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"ICIMD classification"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Shared biochemical function with 6-9 gene products also associated with PMD.

TP dysfunction results in systemic thymidine (dThd) and deoxyuridine (dUrd) overload, which selectively impair mitochondrial DNA replication. Allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation has been used to treat MNGIE patients; however, this approach has serious adverse effects, including the toxicity of myeloablative conditioning, graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease. With the aim of testing the feasibility of gene therapy for MNGIE, we transduced TP-deficient B-lymphoblastoid cells from two MNGIE patients, with lentiviral vectors carrying a functional copy of the human TYMP DNA coding sequence. This restored TP activity in the cells, which reduced the excretion of dThd and dUrd and their concentrations when added in excess. Additionally, lentiviral-mediated hematopoietic gene therapy was used in partially myeloablated double Tymp/Upp1 knockout mice. In spite of the relatively low levels of molecular chimerism achieved, high levels of TP activity were observed in the peripheral blood of the transplanted mice, with a concomitant reduction of nucleoside concentrations. Our results suggest that hematopoietic gene therapy could be an alternative treatment for this devastating disorder in the future.","dc:creator":"Torres-Torronteras J","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Hematopoietic gene therapy restores thymidine phosphorylase activity in a cell culture and a murine model of MNGIE."},"rdfs:label":"Torres-Torronteras 2011 rescue in patient cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Restoration of TP activity and improved nucleoside catabolism with delivery of WT human gene. \nNote: lentiviral or AAV-mediated TYMP expression in the TP/UP double KO mouse model normalizes nucleoside and mitochondrial nucleotide metabolism\n"},{"id":"cggv:5524b9cf-ec26-4412-8172-7da23b3b355e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2273aa11-696e-45ab-9127-c111a7cfd1ad","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Delivered intravenous escalating doses of erythrocyte encapsulated thymidine phosphorylase to 3 adult MNGIE patients:  A genetically engineered recombinant E. coli thymidine phosphorylase sharing a 40% sequence homology with the human was encapsulated into the patient’s autologous erythrocytes ex vivo to produce EE-TP, which was then administered to the patient.

TP deficiency is hypothesized to (i) increase levels of thymidine in plasma, (ii) lead to mitochondrial DNA alterations, and (iii) cause mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE). In order to elucidate the physiological roles of TP, we generated mice deficient in the TP gene. Although TP activity in the liver was inhibited in these mice, it was fully maintained in the small intestine. Murine uridine phosphorylase (UP), unlike human UP, cleaves thymidine, as well as uridine. We therefore generated TP-UP double-knockout (TP(-/-) UP(-/-)) mice. TP activities were inhibited in TP(-/-) UP(-/-) mice, and the level of thymidine in the plasma of TP(-/-) UP(-/-) mice was higher than for TP(-/-) mice. Unexpectedly, we could not observe alterations of mitochondrial DNA or pathological changes in the muscles of the TP(-/-) UP(-/-) mice, even when these mice were fed thymidine for 7 months. However, we did find hyperintense lesions on magnetic resonance T(2) maps in the brain and axonal edema by electron microscopic study of the brain in TP(-/-) UP(-/-) mice. These findings suggested that the inhibition of TP activity caused the elevation of pyrimidine levels in plasma and consequent axonal swelling in the brains of mice. Since lesions in the brain do not appear to be due to mitochondrial alterations and pathological changes in the muscle were not found, this model will provide further insights into the causes of MNGIE.","dc:creator":"Haraguchi M","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Targeted deletion of both thymidine phosphorylase and uridine phosphorylase and consequent disorders in mice."},"rdfs:label":"Haraguchi 2002 KO mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"TP/UP double KO mice show T2-weighted hyperintense lesions on brain MRI and signs of axonal edema by electron microscopy of brain tissue.

The *TYMP* gene encodes thymidine phosphorylase (TP), which catalyzes the conversion of thymidine to thymine and 2-deoxy-D-ribose 1-phosphate. Thymidine-to-thymine conversation is important for nucleoside catabolism. \n\nThe *TYMP* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) in 1999 (PMID: 9924029). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *TYMP*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *TYMP* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included nine unique missense variants, three canonical splice variants, and two frameshift variants reported in 14 unrelated individuals described in two publications (PMIDs: 9924029, 15781193). Additional cases are available in the literature, but the maximum for genetic evidence has been reached. MNGIE is a multisystem disorder caused by TP deficiency that results in severe gastrointestinal dysmotility and skeletal muscle abnormalities due to mtDNA depletion and the accumulation of mtDNA deletions and duplications in various tissues over time. While intrafamilial phenotypic variability and patients with incomplete or atypical clinical manifestations have been described, MNGIE is the only phenotype that has been reported in association with variants in *TYMP*. Later-onset disease has been described for some variants with a less severe impact on TP function. The mechanism of disease is loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by a role in mitochondrial DNA maintenance shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease; rescue of TYMP mRNA and protein levels, TP activity, and nucleoside catabolism via delivery of an intact copy of the human gene in patient cells; and improved disease-related plasma metabolite levels and clinical measures of disease following enzyme replacement therapy in human patients (PMIDs: 12077348, 21451581, 30959750). Of note, mice with knockout of TP do not show a phenotype since, unlike humans, mice can use uridine phosphorylase (UP) to clear thymidine, compensating for the absence of TP. However, a mouse model with double knockout of TP and UP recapitulates some clinical and biochemical features of the disorder, which can be rescued by wildtype gene expression (PMID: 21451581).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *TYMP* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 2, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4efaa60a-76b6-4f99-bf9d-1c91b2b3ce74"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
