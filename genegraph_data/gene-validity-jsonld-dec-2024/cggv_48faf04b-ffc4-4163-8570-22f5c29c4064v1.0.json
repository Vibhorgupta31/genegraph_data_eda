The patients did not exhibit bone marrow failure.

Carcinogenesis resulting from a dysregulated FA pathway is multifaceted, as FA proteins monitor multiple complementary genome-surveillance checkpoints throughout interphase, where monoubiquitylation of the FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer by the FA core complex promotes recruitment of DNA repair effectors to chromatin lesions to resolve DNA damage and mitosis.

The progressive repopulation of wild-type HSCs transplanted into unconditioned Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) recipients is reminiscent of the somatic mosaicism phenomenon observed in a number of genetic diseases, including FA. The hematopoietic phenotype associated with the Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) mutation suggests that this FA-D1 mouse model will constitute an important tool for the development of new therapies for FA, including gene therapy.","dc:creator":"Navarro S","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Hematopoietic dysfunction in a mouse model for Fanconi anemia group D1."},"rdfs:label":"Hematopoietic Dysfunction in a FA-D1 Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:8f46db6e-caa5-4c00-a083-29b78bb0254d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:39c49297-541d-4004-92fc-8ad943a167e1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"These homozygous Brca2-mutant mice have a significantly increased overall tumor incidence and decreased survival compared with their heterozygous littermates.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11861370","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Inherited mutations of the human BRCA2 gene confer increased risks for developing breast, ovarian, and several other cancers. Unlike previously described Brca2 knockout mice that display predominantly embryonic lethal phenotypes, we developed mice with a homozygous germ-line deletion of Brca2 exon 27 that exhibit a moderate decrease in perinatal viability and are fertile. We deleted this Brca2 COOH-terminal domain because it interacts directly with the Rad51 protein, contains a nuclear localization signal, and is required to maintain genomic stability in response to various types of DNA damage. These homozygous Brca2-mutant mice have a significantly increased overall tumor incidence and decreased survival compared with their heterozygous littermates. Virgin female mice homozygous for this Brca2 mutation also display an inhibition of ductal side branching in the mammary gland at 6 months of age. Given their substantial viability and cancer predisposition, these mutant mice will be useful to further define the role of the COOH-terminal Brca2 domain in tumorigenesis both in vivo and in vitro.","dc:creator":"McAllister KA","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Cancer susceptibility of mice with a homozygous deletion in the COOH-terminal domain of the Brca2 gene."},"rdfs:label":"Cancer Susceptibility of Mice with Homozygous Brca2 Deletion"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Showed high incidence of cancer in mice with hypomorphic mutations in Brca2, but not specific in mouse hematopoiesis."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":250,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:3b98b141-17ec-4b18-92df-9c5a80cd80ee","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0011584","gene":"hgnc:1101","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"There is abundant evidence published associating the BRCA2 gene with Fanconi anemia complementation group D1, since the gene-disease relationship was first proposed by Howlett et al. (2002). Multiple case level studies have been performed with FA patients that have variants in the BRCA2 gene. BRCA1, BRIP1, RAD51C, PALB2 have also been established as FA genes in the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway. Multiple Brca2 deficient mouse models have been established to show consistent phenotypes with FA patients including increased overall tumor incidence, decreased survival and hematopoietic dysfunction. Wildtype BRCA2 cDNA restored mitomycin C (MMC) resistance in patient derived fibroblasts. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the BRCA2 gene and Fanconi anemia complementation group D1.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:48faf04b-ffc4-4163-8570-22f5c29c4064"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
