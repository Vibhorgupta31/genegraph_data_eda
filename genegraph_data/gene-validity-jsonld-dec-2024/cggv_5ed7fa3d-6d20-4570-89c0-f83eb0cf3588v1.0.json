Although in research settings NGS has pinpointed causal alleles using segregation in large families, the key challenge for clinical diagnosis is application to single individuals. To explore its diagnostic use, we performed targeted NGS in 42 unrelated infants with clinical and biochemical evidence of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disease. These devastating mitochondrial disorders are characterized by phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, with more than 100 causal genes identified to date. We performed \"MitoExome\" sequencing of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and exons of ~1000 nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins and prioritized rare mutations predicted to disrupt function. Because patients and healthy control individuals harbored a comparable number of such heterozygous alleles, we could not prioritize dominant-acting genes. However, patients showed a fivefold enrichment of genes with two such mutations that could underlie recessive disease. In total, 23 of 42 (55%) patients harbored such recessive genes or pathogenic mtDNA variants. Firm diagnoses were enabled in 10 patients (24%) who had mutations in genes previously linked to disease. Thirteen patients (31%) had mutations in nuclear genes not previously linked to disease. The pathogenicity of two such genes, NDUFB3 and AGK, was supported by complementation studies and evidence from multiple patients, respectively. The results underscore the potential and challenges of deploying NGS in clinical settings.","dc:creator":"Calvo SE","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Molecular diagnosis of infantile mitochondrial disease with targeted next-generation sequencing."}},"rdfs:label":"Calvo_P28"},{"id":"cggv:5c952a18-5af7-464f-97dd-b11abb933f57","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5c952a18-5af7-464f-97dd-b11abb933f57_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:5c952a18-5af7-464f-97dd-b11abb933f57_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"She had combined deficiency of complexes I, III, and IV in patient fibroblasts (between 26-40% for each).

Here, we have investigated the genetic basis for a mitochondrial protein-synthesis defect associated with a combined oxidative phosphorylation enzyme deficiency in two patients, one of whom presented with encephalomyopathy and the other with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Sequencing of candidate genes revealed the same homozygous mutation (C997T) in both patients in TSFM, a gene coding for the mitochondrial translation elongation factor EFTs. EFTs functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for EFTu, another translation elongation factor that brings aminoacylated transfer RNAs to the ribosomal A site as a ternary complex with guanosine triphosphate. The mutation predicts an Arg333Trp substitution at an evolutionarily conserved site in a subdomain of EFTs that interacts with EFTu. Molecular modeling showed that the substitution disrupts local subdomain structure and the dimerization interface. The steady-state levels of EFTs and EFTu in patient fibroblasts were reduced by 75% and 60%, respectively, and the amounts of assembled complexes I, IV, and V were reduced by 35%-91% compared with the amounts in controls. These phenotypes and the translation defect were rescued by retroviral expression of either EFTs or EFTu. These data clearly establish mutant EFTs as the cause of disease in these patients.

Whole exome sequencing revealed two novel compound heterozygous variants in the TSFM gene, coding for the mitochondrial translation elongation factor EF-Ts. This protein participates in the elongation step of mitochondrial translation by binding and stabilizing the translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). Bioinformatics analysis predicted a destabilization of the EF-Ts variants complex with EF-Tu, in agreement with the dramatic steady-state level reduction of both proteins in the clinically affected myocardium, which demonstrated a combined respiratory chain enzyme deficiency. In patient fibroblasts, the decrease of EF-Ts was paralleled by up-regulation of EF-Tu and induction of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, along with increased expression of respiratory chain subunits and normal oxygen consumption rate. Our report extends the current picture of morphologic phenotypes associated with mitochondrial cardiomyopathies and confirms the heart as a main target of TSFM dysfunction. The compensatory response detected in patient fibroblasts might explain the tissue-specific expression of TSFM-associated disease.","dc:creator":"Perli E","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Novel compound mutations in the mitochondrial translation elongation factor (TSFM) gene cause severe cardiomyopathy with myocardial fibro-adipose replacement."}},{"id":"cggv:8456dbc2-147e-4542-b6cf-6ee8bad51a6c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ceaeae36-42e8-4c3f-b806-14557691e298"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30911037"}],"rdfs:label":"Perli_Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:8456dbc2-147e-4542-b6cf-6ee8bad51a6c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8456dbc2-147e-4542-b6cf-6ee8bad51a6c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:847cabbc-6cbe-4d76-9f61-88a5380ac95e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:847cabbc-6cbe-4d76-9f61-88a5380ac95e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:16b9d26a-b18d-4daa-a276-37b77bee91b4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:16b9d26a-b18d-4daa-a276-37b77bee91b4","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:90544fd6-508d-4b07-9883-2a3f3af2f217"},"phenotypeFreeText":"This boy had lifelong history of cognitive and motor deficits associated with developmental delay.

Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"Disorders of mitochondrial gene expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Disorders of mitochondrial gene expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:5ed7fa3d-6d20-4570-89c0-f83eb0cf3588_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9ff6dab2-f085-45e5-81b5-e6f5f5083045","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:884c0b8a-a81d-4577-93a8-9f5e57d49987","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Pulse labeling of the mitochondrial translation products in fibroblasts from both patients revealed a generalized mitochondrial protein-synthesis defect; however, different polypeptides were variably affected.

The *TSFM* gene encodes the mitochondrial translation elongation factor Ts, an enzyme that catalyzes the exchange of guanine nucleotides on the translation elongation factor Tu (encoded by *TUFM*) during the elongation step of mitochondrial protein translation.  \n\n*TSFM* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2006 (PMID: 17033963). While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *TSFM*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *TSFM* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *TSFM* was first curated by this GCEP for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on January 13, 2020 (SOP v7), with a final classification of Moderate. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes cases with LSS.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes seven variants in 10 probands across eight publications (PMIDs: 17033963, 22277967, 21741925, 25037205, 30297209, 27677415, 30911037, 35071363). Affected individuals are variably affected and there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation. Clinical features seen in affected individuals include LSS disorders, lactic acidosis, seizures, dystonia, ataxia, hyperkinetic movement disorder, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure, hepatomegaly, infantile liver failure, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss. Laboratory findings include elevated lactate, ammonia, and creatine kinase; and ketosis. Muscle biopsies show ragged red fibers, COX-deficient fibers, and combined deficiencies of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complexes I, II, and IV. \n\nLoss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by known biochemical function and functional alteration in patient cells (PMIDs: 33340416, 17033963).  \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *TSFM* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 6, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5ed7fa3d-6d20-4570-89c0-f83eb0cf3588"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
