CFC syndrome is caused by dominant mutations in one of the four genes BRAF, MEK1, MEK2, and KRAS. Only three familial cases of CFC syndrome have been reported to date, whereas the vast majorities are sporadic cases due to de novo mutations. We report on a fourth familial case with transmission of CFC syndrome from father to son due to a novel heterozygous sequence change c.376A>G (p.N126D) in exon 3 of MEK2 gene. This observation further documents the possibility of vertical transmission of CFC syndrome, which appears to be associated with rare mutations and relatively mild intellectual disability in affected individual. The hypomorphic effect of specific mutations particularly regarding neurocognitive issues may be related to the variable fertility of affected individuals.","dc:creator":"Karaer K","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Familial cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome in a father and a son with a novel MEK2 mutation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25487361","rdfs:label":"Karaer 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This paper is a case report of a familial case of CFCS with a patient and his father carrying the same MAP2K2 variant.

Clinically, it overlaps with both Noonan syndrome and Costello syndrome, which are caused by mutations in two genes, PTPN11 and HRAS, respectively. Recently, we identified mutations in KRAS and BRAF in 19 of 43 individuals with CFC syndrome, suggesting that dysregulation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is a molecular basis for CFC syndrome. The purpose of this study was to perform comprehensive mutation analysis in 56 patients with CFC syndrome and to investigate genotype-phenotype correlation. We analyzed KRAS, BRAF, and MAP2K1/2 (MEK1/2) in 13 new CFC patients and identified five BRAF and one MAP2K1 mutations in nine patients. We detected one MAP2K1 mutation in three patients and four new MAP2K2 mutations in four patients out of 24 patients without KRAS or BRAF mutations in the previous study [Niihori et al., 2006]. No mutations were identified in MAPK3/1 (ERK1/2) in 21 patients without any mutations. In total, 35 of 56 (62.5%) patients with CFC syndrome had mutations (3 in KRAS, 24 in BRAF, and 8 in MAP2K1/2). No significant differences in clinical manifestations were found among 3 KRAS-positive patients, 16 BRAF-positive patients, and 6 MAP2K1/2-positive patients. Wrinkled palms and soles, hyperpigmentation and joint hyperextension, which have been commonly reported in Costello syndrome but not in CFC syndrome, were observed in 30-40% of the mutation-positive CFC patients, suggesting a significant clinical overlap between these two syndromes.","dc:creator":"Narumi Y","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Molecular and clinical characterization of cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome: overlapping clinical manifestations with Costello syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17366577","rdfs:label":"CFC80"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This study screened 56 CFC patients for variants in KRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1 and MAP2K2. 43 of these patients previously screened negative for variants in KRAS and BRAF by Niihori et al. 2007.

This study was a mutation analysis of the KRAS, BRAF, MEK1 and MEK2 genes in a total of 130 patients (40 patients with a clinical diagnosis of CFC, 20 patients without HRAS mutations from the French Costello family support group, and 70 patients with NS without PTPN11 or SOS1 mutations).

Analysis of the major phenotypic features suggests significant clinical overlap between CS and CFC. The phenotype associated with MEK mutations seems less severe, and is compatible with normal mental development. Features considered distinctive for CS were also found to be associated with BRAF or MEK mutations. Because of its particular cancer risk, the term \"Costello syndrome\" should only be used for patients with proven HRAS mutation. These results confirm that KRAS is a minor contributor to NS and show that MEK is involved in some cases of NS, demonstrating a phenotypic continuum between the clinical entities. Although some associated features appear to be characteristic of a specific gene, no simple rule exists to distinguish NS from CFC easily.","dc:creator":"Nava C","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Cardio-facio-cutaneous and Noonan syndromes due to mutations in the RAS/MAPK signalling pathway: genotype-phenotype relationships and overlap with Costello syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17704260","rdfs:label":"Nava 3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"This study screened 40 CFC patients for variants in KRAS, BRAF, MEK1, MEK2, PTPN11 and HRAS.

These disorders include neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, and Legius syndrome. Because of the common underlying Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation, the RASopathies exhibit numerous overlapping phenotypic features. The Ras/MAPK pathway plays an essential role in regulating the cell cycle and cellular growth, differentiation, and senescence, all of which are critical to normal development. Therefore, it is not surprising that Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation has profound deleterious effects on both embryonic and later stages of development. The Ras/MAPK pathway has been well studied in cancer and is an attractive target for small-molecule inhibition to treat various malignancies. The use of these molecules to ameliorate developmental defects in the RASopathies is under consideration.

CFC is caused by alteration of activity through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway due to heterogeneous de novo germline mutations in B-Raf mutant proteins, MEK1 and MEK2. Approximately 75% of individuals with CFC have mutations in BRAF. In vitro functional studies demonstrate that many of these mutations confer increase activity upon the mutant protein as compared to the wildtype protein. However, as is seen cancer, some of the B-Raf mutant proteins are kinase impaired. Western blot analyses corroborate kinase assays as determined by mutant proteins phosphorylating downstream effectors MEK and ERK. Approximately 25% of individuals with CFC have mutations in either MEK1 or MEK2 that lead to increased MEK kinase activity as judged by increased phosphorylation of its downstream effector ERK. Unlike BRAF, no somatic mutations have ever been identified in MEK genes. The identification of novel germline BRAF and MEK mutations in CFC will help understand the pathophysiology of this syndrome. Furthermore, it will also provide insight to the normal function of B-Raf and MEK, and contribute to the knowledge of the role of the MAPK pathway in cancer. Since the MAPK pathway has been studied intensively in the context of cancer, numerous therapeutics that specifically target this pathway may merit investigation in this population of patients.","dc:creator":"Rodriguez-Viciana P","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Biochemical characterization of novel germline BRAF and MEK mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"MAP2K2 activity assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"doesn't directly implicate the CFC condition, just the pathogenicity of the  variant."},{"id":"cggv:db0c953f-e7a5-4950-85a4-da0b8dafddde","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e184ad01-2aa2-4d3d-9e8c-732d1a198cf7","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The F57C variant led to a significant increase in phosphorylation of ERK compared to WT.

We recently reported missense germline mutations in the genes MEK1 and MEK2 in patients with CFC. These mutations, including F53S and Y130C MEK1, and F57C MEK2, are the first naturally occurring mutations to be identified in these genes. This study reports data concerning the biochemical functions of the novel mutants, as well as the roles of these MEK genes in the MAPK signaling cascade. Our CFC MEK variants cannot induce ERK unless they are phosphorylated by RAF at two key serine residues in the regulatory loop. When we replaced the serine residues with alanines, ERK phosphorylation was significantly reduced in the presence of RAF. We did find that F57C MEK2 activation was less dependent on RAF signaling than the other mutants. This difference results in F57C MEK2 being resistant to the selective RAF inhibitor SB-590885. All three mutants are sensitive to the MEK inhibitor U0126. The majority of CFC cases result from mutations in B-RAF. A recent report indicates the possibility that cancer cells with activated B-RAF have enhanced, selective sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. Thus, regardless of mutations identified in an individual with CFC, MEK inhibition is a potential therapeutic approach for this population.","dc:creator":"Senawong T","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Germline mutations of MEK in cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome are sensitive to MEK and RAF inhibition: implications for therapeutic options."},"rdfs:label":"F57C variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"this does not directly implicate CFC syndrome, only pathogenicity of the variant."},{"id":"cggv:8cbe9123-f0b3-4972-937a-8ecb49a12fb1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8f8cdae7-c920-4343-9238-bfa0c294b4e8","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The Y134H MAP2K2 from the patient cells showed an increase in ERK phosphorylation activity compare to the WT protein from the control fibroblast.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20518782","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Terao M","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Cutaneous symptoms in a patient with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome and increased ERK phosphorylation in skin fibroblasts."},"rdfs:label":"Patient skin fibroblasts with Y134H"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This study shows that the variant has an impact but does not provide differential support for the CFC association"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":2345,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria5","strengthScore":12.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:55ca8d81-f718-428e-ab59-75f7a9182d08","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0015280","gene":"hgnc:6842","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"2.0","dc:description":"There is a definitive association between alteration of the MAP2K2 gene and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC).
