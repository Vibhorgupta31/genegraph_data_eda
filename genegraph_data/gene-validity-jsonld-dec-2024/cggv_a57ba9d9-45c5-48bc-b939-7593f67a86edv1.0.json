During the last decade, the detection of FXI-deficient patients has shifted from clinical screening identifying mostly severe bleeders to biological screening combining findings of prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and FXI coagulation activity (FXI:C) below 50 U/dl. The goal of this study was to determine the molecular basis of FXI deficiency in western Brittany, France. Over the course of four years, we detected 98 FXI-deficient patients through biological screening, and 44 patients agreed to participate in this study corresponding to 25 index cases. We developed an efficient mutation detection strategy (combining direct sequencing and QFM-PCR to search for heterozygous rearrangements in a routine setting) that detected  F11  mutations in 24 out of the 25 index cases. An unexpected allelic heterogeneity was found, with 14 different single point mutations being detected, among which nine are new. Moreover, a large heterozygous deletion of the entire  F11  gene was detected, and was then further defined using a CGH array as a 4q34.2 telomeric deletion of 7 Mb containing 77 genes. We propose that the observed recurrent mutations may be considered as  genetic tags  of a population.

The homodimeric structure of fXI implies that the product of a single mutant allele could confer disease in a dominant manner through formation of heterodimers with wild-type polypeptide. We studied 2 unrelated patients with fXI levels less than 20% of normal and family histories indicating dominant disease transmission. Both are heterozygous for single amino acid substitutions in the fXI catalytic domain (Gly400Val and Trp569Ser). Neither mutant is secreted by transfected fibroblasts. In cotransfection experiments with a wild-type fXI construct, constructs with mutations common in Ashkenazi Jews (Glu117Stop and Phe283Leu) and a variant with a severe defect in dimer formation (fXI-Gly350Glu) have little effect on wild-type fXI secretion. In contrast, cotransfection with fXI-Gly400Val or fXI-Trp569Ser reduces wild-type secretion about 50%, consistent with a dominant negative effect. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates confirmed that fXI-Gly400Val forms intracellular dimers. The data support a model in which nonsecretable mutant fXI polypeptides trap wild-type polypeptides within cells through heterodimer formation, resulting in lower plasma fXI levels than in heterozygotes for mutations that cause autosomal recessive fXI deficiency.","dc:creator":"Kravtsov DV","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Dominant factor XI deficiency caused by mutations in the factor XI catalytic domain."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15026311","rdfs:label":"Kravtsov_Proband 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The proband was heterozygous for the missense variant, Trp587Ser.

This association was made using case-level and experimental data. More than a 100 pathogenic variants in this gene are reported in humans, ranging from whole gene deletions, partial deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift, missense and splicing variants. Congenital Factor XI deficiency is characterized by a bleeding diathesis, diagnosed by a prolonged aPTT but normal PT and reduced factor XI activity and antigen levels. Mutations in F11 were first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1989 by Asakai et al. (PMID: 2813350).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 10 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 15026311, 15953011, 15180874, 21649796, 2813350, 22159456). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease has been reported to be biallelic loss of function as well as a dominant negative effect (PMID: 15026311, 2813350). \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (4.5 points): FXI activates FIX in the blood coagulation pathway (PMID: 3286010). Mouse and cattle models are reported that recapitulate FXI deficiency (PMID: 15566468, 9518045). In Holstein cows, FXI deficiency is naturally occurring and leads to bleeding symptoms. The deficiency is also reported in dogs (PMID: 5166932).   \n\nIn summary, the F11-Congenital FXI deficiency gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on October 23, 2019 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a57ba9d9-45c5-48bc-b939-7593f67a86ed"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
