Although the genetic basis is partly understood, only a fraction of cases can receive a genetic diagnosis, and a global view of HSP is lacking. By using whole-exome sequencing in combination with network analysis, we identified 18 previously unknown putative HSP genes and validated nearly all of these genes functionally or genetically. The pathways highlighted by these mutations link HSP to cellular transport, nucleotide metabolism, and synapse and axon development. Network analysis revealed a host of further candidate genes, of which three were mutated in our cohort. Our analysis links HSP to other neurodegenerative disorders and can facilitate gene discovery and mechanistic understanding of disease.

Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia 45 (SPG45) with intellectual disability was originally mapped to 10q24.3-q25.1 in a large consanguineous Turkish family in 2009 (Dursun *et al.*, PMID: 19415352). Novarino *et al.* later studied the same family and identified the causative homozygous truncating variant in *NT5C2* by exome sequencing, as well as identifying four additional families with homozygous loss-of-function mutations in *NT5C2*. *NT5C2* encodes the 5'-Nucleotidase Cytosolic II protein which regulates intracellular purine/pyrimidine nucleotides in cooperation with other nucleotidases. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, a single disease assertion exists for NT5C2 and we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern. 7 variants (1 missense, 1 in-frame deletion, 1 nonsense, 4 splice variants) that have been reported in 7 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 28884889, 32153630, 28327087, 29123918, 24482476) are included in this curation. More evidence, including additional genetic data and segregation data, is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *NT5C2* and autosomal recessive complex hereditary spastic paraplegia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebral Palsy GCEP on the meeting date September 5th 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8d359b0c-c719-4f5a-8355-1694398f4b79"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
