To identify retinal-disease-associated genes, we performed exome sequencing in 28 individuals with \"cone-first\" retinal disease and clinical features atypical for ABCA4 retinopathy. We then conducted a gene-based case-control association study with an internal exome data set as the control group. TTLL5, encoding a tubulin glutamylase, was highlighted as the most likely disease-associated gene; 2 of 28 affected subjects harbored presumed loss-of-function variants: c.[1586_1589delAGAG];[1586_1589delAGAG], p.[Glu529Valfs(∗)2];[Glu529Valfs(∗)2], and c.[401delT(;)3354G>A], p.[Leu134Argfs(∗)45(;)Trp1118(∗)]. We then inspected previously collected exome sequence data from individuals with related phenotypes and found two siblings with homozygous nonsense variant c.1627G>T (p.Glu543(∗)) in TTLL5. Subsequently, we tested a panel of 55 probands with retinal dystrophy for TTLL5 mutations; one proband had a homozygous missense change (c.1627G>A [p.Glu543Lys]). The retinal phenotype was highly similar in three of four families; the sibling pair had a more severe, early-onset disease. In human and murine retinae, TTLL5 localized to the centrioles at the base of the connecting cilium. TTLL5 has been previously reported to be essential for the correct function of sperm flagella in mice and play a role in polyglutamylation of primary cilia in vitro. Notably, genes involved in the polyglutamylation and deglutamylation of tubulin have been associated with photoreceptor degeneration in mice. The electrophysiological and fundus autofluorescence imaging presented here should facilitate the molecular diagnosis in further families.","dc:creator":"Sergouniotis PI","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Biallelic variants in TTLL5, encoding a tubulin glutamylase, cause retinal dystrophy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:db2083b7-fe3d-459e-8874-35ed9ebb0785_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:db2083b7-fe3d-459e-8874-35ed9ebb0785_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:50c1ae34-7cb7-4abb-8ce8-d1e029341d8a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:549ceed5-33ee-4733-9c26-145c92a796d1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"qualitative and quantitative assessment of all transcripts revealed that expression of the canonical isoform 001 was overwhelmingly more abundant (more than 40-fold higher than the average of the remainder) and that expression in the retina and testis represented ∼64% of TTLL5 presence across all tissues and organs examined (31 and 33% in testis and retina, respectively)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28173158","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hereditary retinal degenerations encompass a group of genetic diseases characterized by extreme clinical variability.

The two male patients carrying truncating TTLL5 variants also displayed a substantial reduction in sperm motility and infertility, whereas those carrying missense changes were fertile. Defects in this polyglutamylase in humans have recently been associated with cone photoreceptor dystrophy, while mouse models carrying truncating mutations in the same gene also display reduced fertility in male animals. We examined the expression levels of TTLL5 in various human tissues and determined that this gene has multiple viable isoforms, being highly expressed in testis and retina. In addition, antibodies against TTLL5 stained the basal body of photoreceptor cells in rat and the centrosome of the spermatozoon flagellum in humans, suggesting a common mechanism of action in these two cell types.

A photoreceptor specific ORF15 variant of RPGR (RPGR(ORF15)), carrying multiple Glu-Gly tandem repeats and a C-terminal basic domain of unknown function, localizes to the connecting cilium where it is thought to regulate cargo trafficking. Here we show that tubulin tyrosine ligase like-5 (TTLL5) glutamylates RPGR(ORF15) in its Glu-Gly-rich repetitive region containing motifs homologous to the α-tubulin C-terminal tail. The RPGR(ORF15) C-terminal basic domain binds to the noncatalytic cofactor interaction domain unique to TTLL5 among TTLL family glutamylases and targets TTLL5 to glutamylate RPGR. Only TTLL5 and not other TTLL family glutamylases interacts with RPGR(ORF15) when expressed transiently in cells. Consistent with this, a Ttll5 mutant mouse displays a complete loss of RPGR glutamylation without marked changes in tubulin glutamylation levels. The Ttll5 mutant mouse develops slow photoreceptor degeneration with early mislocalization of cone opsins, features resembling those of Rpgr-null mice. Moreover TTLL5 disease mutants that cause human retinal dystrophy show impaired glutamylation of RPGR(ORF15) Thus, RPGR(ORF15) is a novel glutamylation substrate, and this posttranslational modification is critical for its function in photoreceptors. Our study uncovers the pathogenic mechanism whereby absence of RPGR(ORF15) glutamylation leads to retinal pathology in patients with TTLL5 gene mutations and connects these two genes into a common disease pathway.","dc:creator":"Sun X","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Loss of RPGR glutamylation underlies the pathogenic mechanism of retinal dystrophy caused by TTLL5 mutations."},"rdfs:label":"RPGR TTLL5 pull down"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:db2083b7-fe3d-459e-8874-35ed9ebb0785_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ae3bc98b-1faa-4601-99a7-a2a919951fe6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:76d47e76-352b-49be-bcbd-2ea7ee42113f","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"reduced glutamylation of RPGR, detected by GT335 staining","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27162334","rdfs:label":"glutamylation  of RPGR with patient mutations"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:db2083b7-fe3d-459e-8874-35ed9ebb0785_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:72eff3da-a563-413c-b642-20c956250f11","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:938cbc2d-8f73-4b91-9d54-161aa541b295","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"thinning of retina and diminished ERG amplitude are a feature of retinal degeneration","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27162334","rdfs:label":"TTLL5 -/- mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5},{"id":"cggv:db2083b7-fe3d-459e-8874-35ed9ebb0785_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:68e9d976-1a82-44f4-9ea9-bb76ea5bc573_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:68e9d976-1a82-44f4-9ea9-bb76ea5bc573","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:b7fb88fa-fb57-464c-9ebe-74bc438d4a06","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015072.5(TTLL5):c.1586_1589del (p.Glu529ValfsTer2)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA210609"}},"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:f0a6faf7-e3df-44a2-bed2-ede0a6a9ae0d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:b7fb88fa-fb57-464c-9ebe-74bc438d4a06"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24791901"},"rdfs:label":"CD1"},{"id":"cggv:f0a6faf7-e3df-44a2-bed2-ede0a6a9ae0d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f0a6faf7-e3df-44a2-bed2-ede0a6a9ae0d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:31deaa92-1e71-4094-9cee-d218ab982356_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31deaa92-1e71-4094-9cee-d218ab982356","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":37,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:84a2646a-052a-432e-900d-d4b315ff3ea7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015072.5(TTLL5):c.3177_3180del (p.Asn1060Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7279948"}},{"id":"cggv:65113bed-a82a-45a7-86bf-54666da21e9a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015072.5(TTLL5):c.1475G>A (p.Trp492Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA390465855"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:ea24d2ce-cd82-4189-84cf-38f93a3b6620_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:65113bed-a82a-45a7-86bf-54666da21e9a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35365235","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Inherited retinal dystrophies describe a heterogeneous group of retinal diseases that lead to the irreversible degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors and eventual blindness.

*TTLL5* gene, which encodes tubulin tyrosine ligase-like family member five, was first reported in 2014 as a cause of autosomal recessive cone and cone-rod dystrophies (Sergouniotis, et al., 2014; PMID 24791901). We found TTL5-related disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, with biallelic disease-causing *TTLL5* variants causing a range of retinopathies. To date, TTLL5-related retinopathies appear to be characterized by a cone-first phenotype, and include cone dystrophy, cone-rod dystrophy and early onset retinal dystrophy (PMID: 34203883). Some cases have been associated with male infertility, and at least one case with associated hearing loss has been described (PMID: 35365235). Because the cases with different diagnoses and syndromic features all exhibit a recessive mode of inheritance and share overlapping phenotypes consistent with a single spectrum of disease, and consistent with criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, these cases have been lumped into a single disease entity, TTLL5-related retinopathy.\n\nThis curation has scored six suspected disease-causing variants (five nonsense variants and one missense variant) that have been reported in six probands in three publications (PMIDs: 24791901, 34203883, 35365235). Homozygous variants in families from multiple countries were included in the curation (PMIDs: 34203883, 24791901) from both consanguineous and non-consanguineous families. While cases harbor apparent null variants, missense variants have also been associated with TTLL5-related disease (PMID: 20237254). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function, as multiple nonsense or frameshift mutations resulting in TTLL5-related disease are described in the literature (PMID 24791901, 34203883, 35365235). Deletions also appear to represent a mechanism of pathogenicity (PMID:34203883, 32783370), perhaps representing up to 20% of the mutational load in the gene. While precise genotype-phenotype correlations have not been described, mutational hot spots in two functional domains have emerged. \n\nThe *TTLL5* gene was originally described (previously called STAMP; PMID 17116691) in 2007. Like other members of the superfamily, it is involved in post-translational modifications of α- and β-tubulin, key components of the axonemes. A mouse gene knockout was initially described with fertility defects and normal retinal function (PMID: 23558686); however, detailed study of the knockout mice revealed cone-rod dysfunction in older animals, including electroretinogram defects (PMID: 27162334). Expression of *TTLL5* has also been validated in human retina (PMIDs: 24791901, 28173158). TTLL5 plays a role in glutamylation of RPGR, another major retinal dystrophy gene, and this function is apparently disrupted by human disease-causing mutations in TTLL5 (PMID: 27162334). Several studies have confirmed the physical interaction between TTLL5 and RPGR *in vitro* (PMID:27162334, 28173158). Multiple cell culture models support the role of TTLL5 in cellular ciliary structures, as TTLL5 localizes to ciliary structures *in vitro* (PMIDs: 27846257, 33833316, 35410372).\n\nIn summary, *TTLL5*  is definitively associated with autosomal recessive TTLL5-related retinopathy. This association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on October 5th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:db2083b7-fe3d-459e-8874-35ed9ebb0785"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
