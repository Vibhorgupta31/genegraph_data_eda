We now report the identification by whole exome sequencing of the missense mutation changing proline 47 into threonine in the first WW domain of the WW domain containing oxidoreductase gene, WWOX, located in the linkage interval. Proline 47 is a highly conserved residue that is part of the WW motif consensus sequence and is part of the hydrophobic core that stabilizes the WW fold. We demonstrate that proline 47 is a key amino acid essential for maintaining the WWOX protein fully functional, with its mutation into a threonine resulting in a loss of peptide interaction for the first WW domain. We also identified another highly conserved homozygous WWOX mutation changing glycine 372 to arginine in a second consanguineous family. The phenotype closely resembled the index family, presenting with generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy, mental retardation and ataxia, but also included prominent upper motor neuron disease. Moreover, we observed that the short-lived Wwox knock-out mouse display spontaneous and audiogenic seizures, a phenotype previously observed in the spontaneous Wwox mutant rat presenting with ataxia

Importantly, four patients demonstrated facial dysmorphism.

Patients often present with seizures and other phenotypes including: global developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and hypotonia. Of note, an assertion has also been made for a relationship between *WWOX* and spinocerebellar ataxia (OMIM:614322). At the time of curation, there were few cases of individuals with variants in *WWOX* and spinocerebellar ataxia available in the literature. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern, and little difference in phenotypic variability between DEE and spinocerebellar ataxia in patients with *WWOX* variants. Given the evidence available at this time, the group feels that spinocerebellar ataxia fits best as part of a broader spectrum of disease, rather than a distinct gene-disease relationship. Therefore, we have lumped these cases into one curation for autosomal recessive DEE (MONDO:0100062).\n\nEleven variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice-site, deletions) reported in nine probands in four publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 24456803, 24369382, 25411445, 30853297). Of note, some cases in Mignot et al. (2015, PMID: 25411445) include copy number variants that cannot yet be scored in the GCI. For that reason, they are detailed here in the evidence summary. We have scored the compound heterozygous multi-exon deletions in exons 1-5 and 6-8 reported in patient 1 at 1 point each. Patient 2 was reported to have a deletion spanning exon 6, along with a p.Trp335* nonsense variant (ClinVar: 180249), both scored at 1 point. This additional evidence therefore adds 4 points to the genetic evidence category. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model (PMIDs: 24369382). In summary, there is a definitive relationship between *WWOX* and autosomal recessive DEE (MONDO:0100062). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 3, 2021 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9da233ef-bf3b-43c5-b82c-c7a6ea4dd5a6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
