NFs function by determining axonal caliber, promoting axonal growth and forming a 3-dimensional lattice that supports the organization of cytoplasmic organelles. The stoichiometry of NF protein subunits (NFL, NFM and NFH) has to be tightly controlled to avoid the formation of NF neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs), axonal degeneration and neuronal death, all pathological hallmarks of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The post-transcriptional control of NF transcripts is critical for regulating normal levels of NF proteins. Previously, we showed that miRNAs that are dysregulated in ALS spinal cord regulate the levels of NEFL mRNA. In order to complete the understanding of altered NF expression in ALS, in this study we have investigated the regulation of NEFM and NEFH mRNA levels by miRNAs. We observed that a small group of ALS-linked miRNAs that are expressed in human spinal motor neurons directly regulate NEFM and NEFH transcript levels in a manner that is associated with an increase in NFM and NFH protein levels in ALS spinal cord homogenates. In concert with previous observations demonstrating the suppression of NEFL mRNA steady state levels in ALS, these observations provide support for the hypothesis that the dysregulation of miRNAs in spinal motor neurons in ALS fundamentally alters the stoichiometry of NF expression, leading to the formation of pathological NCIs.","dc:creator":"Campos-Melo D","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Dysregulation of human NEFM and NEFH mRNA stability by ALS-linked miRNAs."},"rdfs:label":"SALS Spinal Cord Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":6581,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":2.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:4038f00d-6ccc-41bc-88d9-559e1aae22c2","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0004976","gene":"hgnc:7737","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*NEFH* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 1994 (Figlewicz et al., PMID: 7849698). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability (PMIDs: 27040688, 34518334, 7849698). Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal, type 2CC (OMIM: 616924) and susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (OMIM: 105400). The split curation for autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal, type 2CC has been curated separately. 20 variants (missense and large deletions) that have been reported in 20 probands in 13 publications (PMIDs: 29650794, 7849698, 9931323, 34511133, 8871580, 9875737, 21220648, 25299611, 28160950,      29411640, 31788332, 31475037, 32166880) are included in this curation. Additional variants in *NEFH* have been reported but were not scored in this curation due to high minor allele frequencies in population databases. Coding repeats in the KSP repeat region of *NEFH* affect phosphorylation and axonal integrity as the cross-bridge interaction with microtubules and other neurofilaments is destroyed, leading to cytoplasmic inclusions containing intermediate filament proteins. Missense variants residing mainly in the KSP repeat region have more recently been associated with ALS. Multiple screening and targeted sequencing panel studies have found that missense variants may modify risk for ALS. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (an expression study).  RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed an increase in transcript and protein levels of *NEFH* in sALS spinal cord (PMID:30029677). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on the meeting date March 23, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6c71deac-6b11-4947-8834-8391d516a9c9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
