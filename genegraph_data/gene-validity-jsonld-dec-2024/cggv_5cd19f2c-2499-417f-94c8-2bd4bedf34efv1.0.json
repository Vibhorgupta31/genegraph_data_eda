In the present study, we examined the correlation between the expression levels of these genes and the levels of pathologic markers for motor neuron degeneration (i.e. cytoplasmic accumulation of phosphorylated neurofilament H [pNF-H] and ubiquitylated protein) and the numbers of residual motor neurons in 20 autopsies of patients with sporadic ALS. DCTN1 and EGR3 were widely downregulated, and the changes in gene expression were correlated to the number of residual motor neurons. In particular, DCTN1 was markedly downregulated in most residual motor neurons before the accumulation of pNF-H, even in cases with well-preserved motor neuron populations. ACATN, DR5, and CCNC were upregulated in subpopulations of residual motor neurons, and their expression levels were well correlated with the levels of pNF-H accumulation and the number of residual motor neurons. The expressions of DCTN1, EGR3, ACATN, and DR5 were all markedly altered before ubiquitylated protein accumulation. DCTN1 downregulation appears to be an early event before the appearance of neurodegeneration markers, whereas upregulations of DR5 and CCNC are relatively later phenomena associated with pathologic markers and leading to neuronal death.

In the present study, we generated a Caenorhabditis elegans model in which the expression of DNC-1, the homolog of dynactin 1, is specifically knocked down in motor neurons.

It has a role in axon maintenance, regulating vesicle and organelle transport via direct binding to microtubules, the molecular motor dynein, and various cargoes. *DCTN1* was first reported in relation to distal hereditary motor neuronopathy type 7B (dHMN7B; OMIM: 607641) in 2003 (Puls et al., PMID: 12627231). This association led to interest in screening a cohort of individuals with ALS (OMIM: 105400) for variants in *DCTN1*, and heterozygous missense variants of interest were found in four cases (Munch et al. 2004, PMID: 15326253). The gene was finally associated with Perry Syndrome (OMIM: 168605) through genome-wide linkage analyis (Farrer et al. 2009, PMID: 19136952). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we did not find a distinct difference between the molecular mechanism, phenotypic variability, or inheritance pattern of dHMN7B and ALS; therefore, these diseases were lumped for the purposes of gene curation. However, we found a difference in phenotypic variability between Perry Syndrome and ALS, and these disease entities were split. The gene was curated for the lumped ALS and dHMN7B, but the curation for Perry Syndrome was not completed as it is considered outside the phenotypic scope of the GCEP.\n\nThe association between *DCTN1* and ALS was first established in a candidate gene analysis that used Sanger sequencing to assess all exons of the gene in 108 familial and 142 sporadic ALS cases, finding variants in 4 individuals (Munch et al, 2004, PMID: 15326253). No case-control analyses were scorable for the curation of DCTN1. The dHMN7B family in which the first variant in *DCTN1* was identified was the only family segregation included in the scoring (Puls et al., PMID: 12627231). Additionally, 11 variants - including 10 missense variants and 1 insertion variant - reported in 11 probands from 10 publications were scored in this curation. Based on the curation, a genetic evidence score of 4.7 was reached. The majority of variants identified in *DCTN1* appear to be missense variants.\n\nThe gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence describing a physical interaction with another known ALS associated protein, TDP-43 (PMIDs: 33924373); aberrant expression in patient cells (PMID: 17620987); functional alterations in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 33924373); and establishment of model organisms and rescues (PMIDs: 18094236, 29490687, 31291987, 23408943, and 18305234). An experimental evidence score of 5.25 was reached.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, particularly regarding the molecular mechanism of pathogenic variants, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on the meeting date July 27, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5cd19f2c-2499-417f-94c8-2bd4bedf34ef"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
