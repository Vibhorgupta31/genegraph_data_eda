Using a positional cloning approach, we have mapped and isolated the gl locus from a approximately 1.5 cM genetic interval. The gl locus was identified in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig by functional genetic complementation in transgenic mice. Genomic sequence analysis revealed that the gl mutation is a deletion resulting in complete loss of function. The unique approximately 3 kb wild-type transcript is expressed primarily in osteoclasts and melanocytes as well as in brain, kidney, thymus and spleen. The gl gene is predicted to encode a 338-amino acid type I transmembrane protein that localizes to the intracellular compartment. Mutation in the human GL gene leads to severe recessive osteopetrosis. Our studies show that mouse Gl protein function is absolutely required for osteoclast and melanocyte maturation and function.","dc:creator":"Chalhoub N","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Grey-lethal mutation induces severe malignant autosomal recessive osteopetrosis in mouse and human."}},"rdfs:label":"c.949+5G>A (homozyg.)"},{"id":"cggv:1f602fbf-d58a-4144-a762-6cfdf2099561","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1f602fbf-d58a-4144-a762-6cfdf2099561_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:1f602fbf-d58a-4144-a762-6cfdf2099561_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RT-PCR amplification across exon 5 of gene showed aberrant products: (1): retention of part of intron 4 with skipping of exon 5, 355 basepairs (bp) long; (2): skipping of exon 5, 303 bp long; and heteroduplex (1) + (2)."}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Due to the functional evidence, it was not downgraded for homozygosity/possible consanguinity, but the variant was not upgraded for the functional evidence as the evidence was not phenotype specific.

The pathophysiological basis is inadequate bone resorption due to osteoclast dysfunction. In the majority of cases, mutations in either of two human genes cause this fatal disorder: TCIRG1, encoding a subunit of the osteoclast H(+)-ATPase, and the voltage-gated chloride channel gene CLCN7. We excluded both genes in a small inbred family with malignant infantile osteopetrosis and undertook linkage analysis of several candidate loci that are involved in murine osteopetrosis. A region spanning more than 20 cM between the markers D6S1717 and D6S1608 on chromosome 6q21 was found to be homozygous in the affected child. This locus is syntenic to the genomic region harboring the gene for the osteopetrotic mutant mouse grey-lethal (gl). Recently, mutations in a novel gene of unknown function were described in the grey-lethal mouse and in one human patient. Mutation screening of the grey-lethal gene (OSTM1), revealed a homozygous 2-bp deletion in exon 2 (c.415_416delAG) in the affected child. No mutations could be found in six independent ARO patients who had tested negative for mutations in TCIRG1 and CLCN7. In summary, we describe the identification of a novel mutation in the coding sequence of the human grey-lethal gene, which is the second OSTM1 mutation found in human ARO, confirming the involvement of this gene in the pathogenesis of this severe bone disease.","dc:creator":"RamÃ­rez A","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Identification of a novel mutation in the coding region of the grey-lethal gene OSTM1 in human malignant infantile osteopetrosis."}},"rdfs:label":"p.Gln140fs*11 (homozygous, case 1)"},{"id":"cggv:a36de037-813a-42e2-97a1-a35ca1dcb114","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a36de037-813a-42e2-97a1-a35ca1dcb114_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgrading for homozygosity/consanguinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:25959d42-dae2-47e8-a14c-4fcbd7540491_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:25959d42-dae2-47e8-a14c-4fcbd7540491_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:51fb0445-7e70-41c6-89ce-9dfca40308e8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:18a81f1f-c378-4bb5-b8a2-25dd229c0740","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"OSTM1 and CLCN7 co-localize to ruffled border of osteoclasts, as well as in endosomes and lysosomes of different tissues.

Severe osteopetrosis is also observed with mutations in the OSTM1 gene, which encodes a membrane protein of unknown function. Here we show that both ClC-7 and Ostm1 proteins co-localize in late endosomes and lysosomes of various tissues, as well as in the ruffled border of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Co-immunoprecipitations show that ClC-7 and Ostm1 form a molecular complex and suggest that Ostm1 is a beta-subunit of ClC-7. ClC-7 is required for Ostm1 to reach lysosomes, where the highly glycosylated Ostm1 luminal domain is cleaved. Protein but not RNA levels of ClC-7 are greatly reduced in grey-lethal mice, which lack Ostm1, suggesting that the ClC-7-Ostm1 interaction is important for protein stability. As ClC-7 protein levels in Ostm1-deficient tissues and cells, including osteoclasts, are decreased below 10% of normal levels, Ostm1 mutations probably cause osteopetrosis by impairing the acidification of the osteoclast resorption lacuna, which depends on ClC-7 (ref. 3). The finding that grey-lethal mice, just like ClC-7-deficient mice, show lysosomal storage and neurodegeneration in addition to osteopetrosis implies a more general importance for ClC-7-Ostm1 complexes.","dc:creator":"Lange PF","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"ClC-7 requires Ostm1 as a beta-subunit to support bone resorption and lysosomal function."},"rdfs:label":"CLCN7 & OSTM1 interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c495b085-9130-41ee-b47c-ec10dab3717f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:663e6a22-b747-4ff8-a441-4f724db09eb3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is key in the growth and stability of bones.

Recently, mutations in the OSTM1 gene were found to be the cause of severe autosomal recessive osteopetrosis in both the mouse and humans. This disorder is characterized by increased bone mass resulting from a defect in osteoclast maturation. The possible role of OSTM1 in signaling of the Wnt/beta-catenin \"canonical\" pathway was investigated in totipotent mouse F9 embryonal teratocarcinoma cells. Overexpression of OSTM1 in F9 cells increased Wnt3a-responsive beta-catenin accumulation and Lef/Tcf-sensitive transcription. Similarly, knockdown of endogenous OSTM1 attenuated the ability of Wnt3a to stimulate the canonical signaling pathway. An OSTM1 mutant (detected in humans with osteopetrosis) was expressed in F9 cells and found to inhibit Wnt-stimulated beta-catenin stabilization, gene transcription, and primitive endoderm formation. Expression of this OSTM1 C-terminal deletion mutant attenuated Lef/Tcf-sensitive gene transcription, even when transcription was activated by expression of a constitutively-active form of beta-catenin. However, expression of this OSTM1 C-terminal deletion mutant was unable to alter Lef/Tcf-sensitive gene transcription when transcription was activated by expression of a beta-catenin/Lef chimeric protein. From the standpoint of protein-protein interactions, expression of wild-type OSTM1 stimulated whereas mutant OSTM1 inhibited, the Wnt-dependent association of beta-catenin and Lef1. On the foundation of these experiments, we propose that the human mutations in OSTM1 such as the C-terminal deletion mutant studied herein provoke dysregulation of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, providing a molecular basis for severe autosomal recessive osteopetrosis.","dc:creator":"Feigin ME","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"OSTM1 regulates beta-catenin/Lef1 interaction and is required for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling."},"rdfs:label":"Biochemical functional evidence (mouse embryonic cells)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:25959d42-dae2-47e8-a14c-4fcbd7540491_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7a4d0e46-5dbf-40bf-9ad8-59c09f43ddfa","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4e2c2479-e7a4-424f-8fbd-ad88706a2728","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The Lef/TcF-controlled transcriptional response to WNT3A was reduced by over 70 % in those given siRNA targeting OSTM1.

More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (interaction, biochemical functional, and functional alteration evidence, as well as a mouse model; PMIDs: 12627228, 16525474, 16813530, 18296023). OSTM1 interacts with CLCN7 by co-localizing and assembling into a structure that includes both proteins. CLCN7 has been classified as definitive for both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive osteopetrosis by the Skeletal Disorders GCEP. Biochemical functional and functional alteration evidence show that OSTM1 is necessary in signaling processes associated with bone development. The mouse model shows that mutant mice have osteoporosis, early lethality, and brain anomalies, just like affected humans. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *OSTM1* and autosomal recessive osteopetrosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
