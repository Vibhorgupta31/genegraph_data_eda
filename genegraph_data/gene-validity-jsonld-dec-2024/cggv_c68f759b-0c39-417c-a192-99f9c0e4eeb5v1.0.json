In addition, a variety of developmental defects (e.g., vertebral anomalies) may occur. MPSs are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous but are traditionally divided into prenatally lethal and nonlethal (Escobar) types. To elucidate the pathogenesis of MPS, we undertook a genomewide linkage scan of a large consanguineous family and mapped a locus to 2q36-37. We then identified germline-inactivating mutations in the embryonal acetylcholine receptor gamma subunit (CHRNG) in families with both lethal and nonlethal MPSs. These findings extend the role of acetylcholine receptor dysfunction in human disease and provide new insights into the pathogenesis and management of fetal akinesia syndromes.","dc:creator":"Morgan NV","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Mutations in the embryonal subunit of the acetylcholine receptor (CHRNG) cause lethal and Escobar variants of multiple pterygium syndrome."},{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16826520","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Escobar syndrome is a form of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and features joint contractures, pterygia, and respiratory distress. Similar findings occur in newborns exposed to nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies from myasthenic mothers. We performed linkage studies in families with Escobar syndrome and identified eight mutations within the gamma -subunit gene (CHRNG) of the AChR. Our functional studies show that gamma -subunit mutations prevent the correct localization of the fetal AChR in human embryonic kidney-cell membranes and that the expression pattern in prenatal mice corresponds to the human clinical phenotype. AChRs have five subunits. Two alpha, one beta, and one delta subunit are always present. By switching gamma to epsilon subunits in late fetal development, fetal AChRs are gradually replaced by adult AChRs. Fetal and adult AChRs are essential for neuromuscular signal transduction. In addition, the fetal AChRs seem to be the guide for the primary encounter of axon and muscle. Because of this important function in organogenesis, human mutations in the gamma subunit were thought to be lethal, as they are in gamma -knockout mice. In contrast, many mutations in other subunits have been found to be viable but cause postnatally persisting or beginning myasthenic syndromes. We conclude that Escobar syndrome is an inherited fetal myasthenic disease that also affects neuromuscular organogenesis. Because gamma expression is restricted to early development, patients have no myasthenic symptoms later in life. This is the major difference from mutations in the other AChR subunits and the striking parallel to the symptoms found in neonates with arthrogryposis when maternal AChR auto-antibodies crossed the placenta and caused the transient inactivation of the AChR pathway.","dc:creator":"Hoffmann K","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Escobar syndrome is a prenatal myasthenia caused by disruption of the acetylcholine receptor fetal gamma subunit."}],"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c68f759b-0c39-417c-a192-99f9c0e4eeb5_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c68f759b-0c39-417c-a192-99f9c0e4eeb5_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:330318f2-a690-4d30-8c11-345c7e193c3c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cc1b532b-6517-4be5-8ce9-951839cdc225","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Postnatally, ùõæ is expressed at P1 and P4 but decreased by P7, whereas ùúÄ is absent at P1, visible at P4 and robust at P7\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16826520","rdfs:label":"Mouse expression data"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0a81a2d8-159e-4fc7-952c-9891c2524fbb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:23c2cb8e-f673-40c2-9380-4ee531a0df3f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"RNASeq data","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18252226","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Impaired fetal movement causes malformations, summarized as fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS), and is triggered by environmental and genetic factors. Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) components are suspects because mutations in the fetally expressed gamma subunit (CHRNG) of AChR were found in two FADS disorders, lethal multiple pterygium syndrome (LMPS) and Escobar syndrome. Other AChR subunits alpha1, beta1, and delta (CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND) as well as receptor-associated protein of the synapse (RAPSN) previously revealed missense or compound nonsense-missense mutations in viable congenital myasthenic syndrome; lethality of homozygous null mutations was predicted but never shown. We provide the first report to our knowledge of homozygous nonsense mutations in CHRNA1 and CHRND and show that they were lethal, whereas novel recessive missense mutations in RAPSN caused a severe but not necessarily lethal phenotype. To elucidate disease-associated malformations such as frequent abortions, fetal edema, cystic hygroma, or cardiac defects, we studied Chrna1, Chrnb1, Chrnd, Chrng, and Rapsn in mouse embryos and found expression in skeletal muscles but also in early somite development. This indicates that early developmental defects might be due to somite expression in addition to solely muscle-specific effects. We conclude that complete or severe functional disruption of fetal AChR causes lethal multiple pterygium syndrome whereas milder alterations result in fetal hypokinesia with inborn contractures or a myasthenic syndrome later in life.","dc:creator":"Michalk A","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Acetylcholine receptor pathway mutations explain various fetal akinesia deformation sequence disorders."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:c68f759b-0c39-417c-a192-99f9c0e4eeb5_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6959b39e-d778-41e1-904a-a2f35d41f3a4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1211485a-1e08-4d62-ade3-6c9f449db9e7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Mice were born at 50% expected Mendelian frequency, heterozygotes normal.

Homozygotes born alive survived for 2 days in a stable condition, and were able to move their forelimbs. Endplate AChRs included epsilon-subunits, and muscle fibers had multiple neuromuscular junctions.

CHRNG mutations lead to a distinctive phenotype characterized by multiple congenital contractures, pterygium, and facial dysmorphism, with a stable clinical course over the years. Postnatal abnormalities at the neuromuscular junction were observed in the muscle biopsy of these patients. WBMRI showed distinctive features different from other arthrogryposis multiple congenita. A marked muscle bulk reduction is the predominant finding, mostly affecting the spinal erector muscles and gluteus maximus. Fatty infiltration was only observed in deep paravertebral muscles and distal lower limbs. Mutations in CHRNG are mainly located at the extracellular domain of the protein. Our study contributes to further define the phenotypic spectrum of CHRNG-related nonlethal MPS, including muscle imaging features, which may be useful in distinguishing it from other diffuse arthrogryposis entities.","dc:creator":"Carrera-Garc√≠a L","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"CHRNG-related nonlethal multiple pterygium syndrome: Muscle imaging pattern and clinical, histopathological, and molecular genetic findings."}},{"id":"cggv:e0949654-bfdb-45f5-a328-8553a8da534f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ec466e8a-f6e9-451b-bd52-31f5772b5ce8"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30868735"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 7"},{"id":"cggv:d554c4a3-f94b-4112-8b8e-d5932069fcee","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d554c4a3-f94b-4112-8b8e-d5932069fcee_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:e0949654-bfdb-45f5-a328-8553a8da534f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e0949654-bfdb-45f5-a328-8553a8da534f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c68f759b-0c39-417c-a192-99f9c0e4eeb5_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:dc732469-4b70-456c-b380-d5ec5aa5d0fc_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dc732469-4b70-456c-b380-d5ec5aa5d0fc","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"WeeksGestation","ageValue":20,"allele":{"id":"cggv:b8c4b5d4-6f6a-4a37-a822-80be1f53c801","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005199.5(CHRNG):c.459dup (p.Val154SerfsTer24)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2168671"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Hand clenching, scoliosis, pterygium, polyhydramnios, reduced fetal movement","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002948","obo:HP_0001561","obo:HP_0002650","obo:HP_0001558","obo:HP_0001059","obo:HP_0001188"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:d6e59cbe-1398-43dd-b7f6-835bb5b0ba78_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:b8c4b5d4-6f6a-4a37-a822-80be1f53c801"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34440395"},"rdfs:label":"P2"},{"id":"cggv:d6e59cbe-1398-43dd-b7f6-835bb5b0ba78","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d6e59cbe-1398-43dd-b7f6-835bb5b0ba78_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:6227cd94-b1ff-4cb5-8da0-618706a5f184_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6227cd94-b1ff-4cb5-8da0-618706a5f184","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:1a9cfad0-6037-45a8-be85-0e678de12ea9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005199.5(CHRNG):c.136C>T (p.Arg46Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA128053"}},"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:d57a1601-69de-4881-bcbb-b78f764e61fb_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1a9cfad0-6037-45a8-be85-0e678de12ea9"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16826531"},"rdfs:label":"MPS002 - sisters"},{"id":"cggv:d57a1601-69de-4881-bcbb-b78f764e61fb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d57a1601-69de-4881-bcbb-b78f764e61fb_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Default score changed due to consanguinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6915,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:406faa04-9748-467a-999c-4b79fe7846e6","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100158","gene":"hgnc:1967","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Cholinergic Receptor, Nicotinic, Gamma Polypeptide (CHRNG; MIM#100730) is the gamma subunit of the Acetylcholine receptor (AChR).  CHRNG is the variable subunit of AChR, which is present in humans before 33 weeks of gestational age and replaced by the ùúÄ subunit (CHRNE; MIM#100725) in late fetal and perinatal period.  Fetal AChR is critical for establishing muscle-axon interface and neuromuscular junctions as well as prenatal neuromuscular signal transduction.  Biallelic pathogenic variants in CHRNG are associated with CHRNG-associated hypo-akinesia disorder of prenatal onset (MONDO:0100158) with autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.  Clinical phenotypes are variable include prenatal akinesia and associated resulting phenotypes, pterygium, poly- or oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, cystic hygroma, hydrops, reduced fetal movements, muscle weakness, congenital contractures, and fetal demise or stillbirth.  The molecular etiology of CHRNG-associated disease was first reported by Hoffmann (2006; PMID:16826520) and Morgan (2006; PMID:16826531), and since has been reported in many additional male and female probands and found to segregate with disease in families and genetic evidence was scored at the maximum of 12 points [PMIDs:16826520, 16826531, 30868735, 34440395].  Functional evidence including expression studies [PMID:18252226, 16826520] and a mouse model recapitulating the observed human phenotype [PMID:12101101] were scored for an additional 3.0 points.  Given this and its replication in the literature over time, the association of CHRNG with CHRNG-associated hypo-akinesia disorder of prenatal onset is curated as Definitive by the Prenatal Gene Curation Expert Panel.\n\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c68f759b-0c39-417c-a192-99f9c0e4eeb5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
