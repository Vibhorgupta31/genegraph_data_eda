It manifests with loss of vision in childhood due to retinal degeneration, followed by seizures and parkinsonism leading to premature death at around 30 years. Eighty-five percent of JNCL patients carry a disease-causing 1.02 kb deletion in the CLN3 gene on chromosome 16. Here we report on a large consanguineous Lebanese family with five affected siblings. Electron microscopy of lymphocytes revealed the presence of fingerprint profiles suggesting JNCL. However, disease progression, especially of mental and motor function was slower as expected for 'classic' JNCL. We thus confirmed the diagnosis by genetic testing and found a new c.597C>A transversion in exon 8, homozygous in all affected family members and not present in 200 alleles of normal controls. The mutation generates a premature termination codon (p.Y199X) truncating the CLN3 protein by 55%. In heterozygous state mutant mRNA transcripts are expressed at the same levels as the wild-type ones, suggesting the absence of nonsense mediated messenger decay. We discuss a potential residual catalytic function of the truncated protein as a cause for the mild phenotype.","dc:creator":"Sarpong A","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Protracted course of juvenile ceroid lipofuscinosis associated with a novel CLN3 mutation (p.Y199X)."}},"rdfs:label":"Sarpong II-7"},{"id":"cggv:216e1d26-2277-4d1e-82fe-40f60b3c78b6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:216e1d26-2277-4d1e-82fe-40f60b3c78b6_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:28d20ed5-77a7-4ad2-a8af-875f07d8e66d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:28d20ed5-77a7-4ad2-a8af-875f07d8e66d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:3208299a-eaa6-4744-a18c-75304665d37c"},"firstTestingMethod":"Restriction digest","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0025190","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0031375","obo:HP_0032794","obo:HP_0002059"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Vacuolated lymphocytes in peripheral blood were present \n","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:0f9b965c-f67f-44d7-80d2-c130d3e9a418_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3208299a-eaa6-4744-a18c-75304665d37c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21499717"},"rdfs:label":"Pérez-Poyato - 11"},{"id":"cggv:0f9b965c-f67f-44d7-80d2-c130d3e9a418","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0f9b965c-f67f-44d7-80d2-c130d3e9a418_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:6be652b4-092f-4d1c-9606-4dfeb689c4b9_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:6a1b5388-7513-4398-843b-c28aa5f12dd9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6a1b5388-7513-4398-843b-c28aa5f12dd9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"cggv:5ce33ce6-edfd-44d7-938e-2d01bb970b64"},"detectionMethod":"molecular genetic testing","firstTestingMethod":"Genotyping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002312","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0007401","obo:HP_0000556","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0000543","obo:HP_0007843"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Biochemical Test: Blood film microscopy shows vacuolated lymphocytes.

NCL patients with variants in *CLN3* are typically diagnosed in childhood with gradual loss of vision that evolves into total blindness, epileptic seizures, muscular deterioration, and cognitive decline. There have been individuals reported with biallelic variants in *CLN3* and an isolated retinal phenotype; these individuals reached adulthood without the other characteristic features of NCL (PMID:24154662). It is unclear at this time how these cases relate to the classic NCL cases; this curation is exclusively for the relationship between CLN3 and NCL. \n\nAlthough many individuals with variants in *CLN3* have been reported in the literature, five variants (e.g. large deletion, missense, frameshift, stop gained and frameshift) from five probands in four publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 31926949, 21499717, 19489875 and 19135632). Of note, the recurrent founder variant (a 1.02kb deletion resulting in the removal of exons 7 and 8 and a premature stop codon at exon 9) is the most frequently observed variant and is seen in approximately 96% of patients (PMID:35599949). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. In summary, there is a definitive relationship between *CLN3* and autosomal recessive neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on the meeting date of April 4, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
