Defects in motile cilia result in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), the most prominent ciliopathy, characterized by the association of respiratory symptoms, male infertility, and, in nearly 50% of cases, situs inversus. So far, most identified disease-causing mutations involve genes encoding various ciliary components, such those belonging to the dynein arms that are essential for ciliary motion. Following a candidate-gene approach based on data from a mutant strain of the biflagellated alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii carrying an ODA7 defect, we identified four families with a PCD phenotype characterized by the absence of both dynein arms and loss-of-function mutations in the human orthologous gene called LRRC50.

An interaction of DNAAF1 with a RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex is consistent with a model where DNAAF1 is part of a larger cytoplasmic multi-protein complex that assembles inner and outer dynein arm components. The AAA+ ATPases RUVBL1 and RUVBL are thought to form a scaffold for complex protein-protein interactions. The structure and ATPase activity of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 can be affected and regulated by the interaction with different proteins (PMID: 33129013).

We describe four families with DNAAF1 mutations and complex congenital heart disease (CHD). In three families, all affected individuals have typical PCD phenotypes. However, an additional family demonstrates isolated CHD (heterotaxy) in two affected siblings, but no clinical evidence of PCD. We identified a homozygous DNAAF1 missense mutation, p.Leu191Phe, as causative for heterotaxy in this family. Genetic complementation in dnaaf1-null zebrafish embryos demonstrated the rescue of normal heart looping with wild-type human DNAAF1, but not the p.Leu191Phe variant, supporting the conserved pathogenicity of this DNAAF1 missense mutation. This observation points to a phenotypic continuum between CHD and PCD, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of isolated CHD. In further investigations of the function of DNAAF1 in dynein arm assembly, we identified interactions with members of a putative dynein arm assembly complex. These include the ciliary intraflagellar transport protein IFT88 and the AAA+â€‰(ATPases Associated with various cellular Activities) family proteins RUVBL1 (Pontin) and RUVBL2 (Reptin). Co-localization studies support these findings, with the loss of RUVBL1 perturbing the co-localization of DNAAF1 with IFT88.

Disruption of their structure or function can have profound phenotypic consequences, and has been linked to left-right patterning and polycystic kidney disease. In a forward genetic screen for mutations affecting ciliary motility, we isolated zebrafish mutant hu255H. The mutation was found to disrupt an ortholog of the uncharacterized highly conserved human SDS22-like leucine-rich repeat(LRR)-containing protein LRRC50 (16q24.1) and Chlamydomonas Oda7p. Zebrafish lrrc50 is specifically expressed in all ciliated tissues. lrrc50(hu255H) mutants develop pronephric cysts with an increased proliferative index, severely reduced brush border, and disorganized pronephric cilia manifesting impaired localized fluid flow consistent with ciliary dysfunction. Electron microscopy analysis revealed ultrastructural irregularities of the dynein arms and misalignments of the outer-doublet microtubules on the ciliary axonemes, suggesting instability of the ciliary architecture in lrrc50(hu255H) mutants. TheSDS22-like leucine-rich repeats present in Lrrc50 are necessary for proper protein function, since injection of a deletion construct of the first LRR did not rescue the zebrafish mutant phenotype. Subcellular distribution of human LRRC50-EGFP in MDCK and HEK293T cells is diffusely cytoplasmic and concentrated at the mitotic spindle poles and cilium.

The PCD phenotype results from structural and/or functional abnormalities of motile cilia and flagella. Ciliary motility is powered by a set of axoneme-specific dynein motor complexes. The cytoplasmic assembly of these large multiprotein complexes before their transport into cilia is assisted by dynein axonemal assembly factors (DNAAFs). Mutations in genes encoding DNAAFs result in the improper cytoplasmic preassembly of dynein chains, causing defects in both inner (IDA) and outer dynein arms (ODA) that can result in cilia immotility (PMID: 31624012). \n\nThe *DNAAF1* (Dynein Axonemal Assembly Factor 1) gene was first reported in relation to PCD by Loges et al. and Duquesnoy et al. in 2009 (PMIDs: 19944400, 19944405).  Loges et al. identified *DNAAF1* (LRRC50) as a candidate disease gene through positional cloning in consanguineous PCD families with combined ODA and IDA defects. *DNAAF1* was specifically targeted for analysis because its orthologs in zebrafish and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, *dnaaf1* and oda7 (PMIDs: 18385425, 17194703), had already been associated with cilia and flagella ultrastructural defects (ODA and IDA defects). Duquesnoy et al. followed a candidate gene approach that similarly targeted *DNAAF1* because of the defective ultrastructural phenotypes seen in C. reinhardtii oda7 mutant strains. Their PCD patients also exhibited an absence of both dynein arms. The specific disease entity, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 13 is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the *DNAAF1* gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism and autosomal recessive mode of inheritance to be consistent among unrelated patients, while the phenotypic variability among them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited *DNAAF1* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 13 (MONDO: 0013174, OMIM # 613193).\n\nEvidence from 10 probands in 5 publications have been included in this curation representing 15 unique variants (1 missense, 3 nonsense, 9 frameshift, and 2 large intragenic deletions) (PMIDs: 19944400, 19944405, 29228333, 32502479, 30067075). The mechanism of pathogenicity in* DNAAF1* mutations appears to be biallelic loss of function. There is additional case-level variant evidence available in the literature, but its inclusion in this curation was not necessary to reach the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points). Of note, in the process of curating genetic evidence for a gene-disease relationship between *DNAAF1* and PCD 13, it was observed that a subset of *DNAAF1* mutations can produce laterality defects in human patients without a complete PCD phenotype. These laterality defects can include complex heart defects and neural tube defects (PMIDs: 29228333, 34215651, 27543293).\n\nThe gene-disease association between *DNAAF1* and PCD 13 is supported by quantitative RT-PCR analysis that confirms that *DNAAF1 *(*LRRC50*) is highly expressed in human trachea, lung, and testis, all tissues containing multi-ciliated cells (PMID: 19944405). In situ hybridization analysis of whole mouse embryos shows Dnaaf1 (Lrrc50)  expression in the node (early gastrulation-stage embryos) and ciliated mouse respiratory epithelial cells (PMID: 1944400). This expression is consistent with a role for *DNAAF1* in ciliary axoneme assembly in motile ciliated cells of the left-right organizer and respiratory epithelial cells of mice and humans. Patients carrying *DNAAF1* mutations can develop severe respiratory symptoms, infertility, and laterality disorders, including in some cases complex congenital heart disease (PMID: 29228333). High-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy in control and *DNAAF1* (LRRC50)  mutant respiratory cells from one PCD patient showed a loss of the ODA heavy chains DNAH5 and DNAH9 and the ODA intermediate chain DNAI2 from the ciliary axonemes.  DNALI1, an IDA component, was also absent from all mutant ciliary axonemes and instead accumulated in the cytoplasm (PMID: 19944400). These data are consistent with *DNAAF1* assisting in the cytoplasmic assembly of axonemal dyneins.\n\nThe cytoplasmic folding and preassembly of dynein arm proteins into larger complexes takes place in a stepwise manner involving interactions with various DNAAFs, chaperones, and co-chaperones (PMID: 31817850). Co-immunoprecipitation assays from human cell culture extracts overexpressing *DNAAF1* confirm the interaction of* DNAAF1* with both endogenous RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 (PMID: 19944405). RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 are components of the R2TP/Prefoldin-like complex, an HSP90 co-chaperone complex involved in the assembly process of many molecular machines. While RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 have not been directly associated with PCD, they have been associated with dysfunction of motile cilia (PMIDs: 23858445, 29959317). The association of *DNAAF1* with an RUVBL1-RUVLB2 complex is consistent with *DNAAF1*â€™s involvement in axonemal dynein arm assembly. \n\nThree non-human models have been used to support the gene-disease relationship between *DNAAF1* and PCD 13. TbODA7 (*DNAAF1*) RNAi silencing in Trypanosoma brucei results in defective flagellar motility, the absence of ODAs, and the cytoplasmic accumulation of DNAI1 (ODA component),  all phenotypes consistent with a defect in dynein arm assembly (PMID: 19944405). Zebrafish embryos carrying a homozygous dnaaf1 mutation have immotile cilia, left-right polarity defects, a deficiency in pronephric fluid flow, and the development of pronephric cysts. Zebrafish mutants are missing outer dynein arms and in some cases have missing or misplaced inner dynein arms. These ultrastructural defects are consistent with a role for dnaaf1 in the preassembly of dynein arms in zebrafish. Mice carrying a homozygous loss of function Dnaaf1 mutation exhibit phenotypes consistent with those seen in PCD patients carrying *DNAAF1* mutations (PMID: 27261005). These phenotypes include severe respiratory infection and laterality defects.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting a gene-disease relationship between variants in *DNAAF1* and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 13. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on March 9, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:41e4b8cd-35bd-4e99-ba2d-606f191a13cf"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
