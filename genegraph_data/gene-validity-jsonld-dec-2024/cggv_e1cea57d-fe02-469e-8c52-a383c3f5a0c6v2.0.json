Hypomorphic Asns mutant mice have structural brain abnormalities, including enlarged ventricles and reduced cortical thickness, and show deficits in learning and memory mimicking aspects of the patient phenotype. ASNS encodes asparagine synthetase, which catalyzes the synthesis of asparagine from glutamine and aspartate. The neurological impairment resulting from ASNS deficiency may be explained by asparagine depletion in the brain or by accumulation of aspartate/glutamate leading to enhanced excitability and neuronal damage.

However, this CNS-limited effect can be explained by the ability of peripheral cells to compensate for ASNS hypo-function by utilising dietary derived asparagine. In contrast, transport of asparagine across the blood–brain-barrier is limited and reliant on transporters that also transfer other amino acids. The CSF content of asparagine is 1–10% that of plasma. Hence, cells within the blood–brain barrier are relatively depleted of exogenous asparagine, and dependent on intracellular ASNS synthesis. Moreover, neuronal cells have a significant requirement for asparagine in the developing and mature brain.

Affected individuals have congenital microcephaly and progressive encephalopathy associated with severe intellectual disability and intractable seizures. The loss of function of the asparagine synthetase (ASNS, EC 6.3.5.4), particularly in the brain, is the major cause of this particular congenital microcephaly. In this study, we clinically evaluated an affected child from a consanguineous Emirati family presenting with congenital microcephaly and epileptic encephalopathy. In addition, whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous substitution mutation (c.1193A > C) in the ASNS gene. This mutation resulted in the substitution of highly conserved tyrosine residue by cysteine (p.Y398C). Molecular modeling analysis predicts hypomorphic and damaging effects of this mutation on the protein structure and altering its enzymatic activity. Therefore, we conclude that the loss of ASNS function is most likely the cause of this condition in the studied family. This report brings the number of reported families with this very rare disorder to five and the number of pathogenic mutations in the ASNS gene to four.

Recently, mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme asparagine synthetase (ASNS) were associated to microcephaly and so far 24 different mutations in ASNS causing microcephaly have been described. In a family with two affected girls, we identified novel compound heterozygous variants in ASNS (c.1165G > C, p.E389Q and c.601delA, p.M201Wfs∗28). The first mutation (E389Q) is a missense mutation resulting in the replacement of a glutamate residue evolutionary conserved from Escherichia coli to Homo sapiens by glutamine. Protein modeling based on the known crystal structure of ASNS of E. coli predicted a destabilization of the protein by E389Q. The second mutation (p.M201Wfs∗28) results in a premature stop codon after amino acid 227, thereby truncating more than half of the protein.

ASD typically presents congenitally with microcephaly and severe, often medically refractory, epilepsy. Development is generally severely affected at birth. Tone is abnormal with axial hypotonia and progressive appendicular spasticity. Hyperekplexia has been reported. Neuroimaging typically demonstrates gyral simplification, abnormal myelination, and progressive cerebral atrophy. The present report describes two siblings from consanguineous parents with a homozygous Arg49Gln variant associated with a milder form of ASD that is characterized by later onset of symptoms. Both siblings had a period of normal development before onset of seizures, and development regression. Primary fibroblast studies of the siblings and their parents document that homozygosity for Arg49Gln blocks cell growth in the absence of extracellular asparagine. Functional studies with these cells suggest no impact of the Arg49Gln variant on basal ASNS mRNA or protein levels, nor on regulation of the gene itself. Molecular modelling of the ASNS protein structure indicates that the Arg49Gln variant lies near the substrate binding site for glutamine. Collectively, the results suggest that the Arg49Gln variant affects the enzymatic function of ASNS.

Because of the high rate of parental consanguinity, which raises the risk for ARID and other recessive disorders, the prevalence of ID is significantly higher in near- and middle-east countries. Indeed, homozygosity mapping and sequencing in consanguineous families have already identified a plethora of ARID genes, but because of the design of these studies, DNMs could not be systematically assessed, and the proportion of cases that are potentially preventable by avoiding consanguineous marriages or through carrier testing is hitherto unknown. This prompted us to perform whole-exome sequencing in 100 sporadic ID patients from Iran and their healthy consanguineous parents. In 61 patients, we identified apparently causative changes in known ID genes. Of these, 44 were homozygous recessive and 17 dominant DNMs. Assuming that the DNM rate is stable, these results suggest that parental consanguinity raises the ID risk about 3.6-fold, and about 4.1 to 4.25-fold for children of first-cousin unions. These results do not rhyme with recent opinions that consanguinity-related health risks are generally small and have been \"overstated\" in the past.","dc:creator":"Kahrizi K","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Effect of inbreeding on intellectual disability revisited by trio sequencing."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30315573","rdfs:label":"M9300103"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"The homozygous missense variant, Ile253Ser is not functionally supported.

Individuals with mutations in the ASNS gene exhibit developmental delays, intellectual disability, microcephaly, intractable seizures, and progressive brain atrophy. Currently, the disease requires molecular diagnosis as some, but not all, affected individuals have a measurable decrease in the amount of asparagine in their serum or cerebrospinal fluid, which limits this analysis as a preliminary screen in suspected cases. At least 24 unique variants (primarily missense but also frameshift and nonsense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in 22 probands in 15 publications (PMIDs: 29375865, 25663424, 25227173, 29405484, 28776279, 30315573, 26318253, 24139043, 29279279, 30057589, 27422383, 27711071, 27469131, 27743885, 26395554). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 10 additional family members. Molecular modeling using the Escherichia coli ASNS-B structure has revealed that most of the reported ASD substitutions are located near catalytic sites or within highly conserved regions of the protein (Reviewed in PMID: 29084849). This gene-disease association is supported by its biochemical function in asparagine synthesis, the functional alteration in patient cells resulting in decreased proliferation, the pattern of expression in the brain similar to that of known microcephaly genes, and a hypomorphic mouse model which recapitulates the human brain phenotypes. In summary, ASNS is definitively associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of asparagine synthetase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e1cea57d-fe02-469e-8c52-a383c3f5a0c6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
