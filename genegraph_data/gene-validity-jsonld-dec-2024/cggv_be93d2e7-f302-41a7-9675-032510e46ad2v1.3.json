Here, we report a detailed cross-sectional analysis of clinical, imaging and molecular data of 156 patients from 101 families. Enrolled patients were of diverse ethnic backgrounds and covered a wide age range (1.0-49.3 years). While the mean age at symptom onset was 0.8 ± 0.6 years [standard deviation (SD), range 0.2-5.0], the mean age at diagnosis was 10.2 ± 8.5 years (SD, range 0.1-46.3). We define a set of core features: early-onset developmental delay with delayed motor milestones and significant speech delay (50% non-verbal); intellectual disability in the moderate to severe range; mild hypotonia in infancy followed by spastic diplegia (mean age: 8.4 ± 5.1 years, SD) and later tetraplegia (mean age: 16.1 ± 9.8 years, SD); postnatal microcephaly (83%); foot deformities (69%); and epilepsy (66%) that is intractable in a subset. At last follow-up, 36% ambulated with assistance (mean age: 8.9 ± 6.4 years, SD) and 54% were wheelchair-dependent (mean age: 13.4 ± 9.8 years, SD). Episodes of stereotypic laughing, possibly consistent with a pseudobulbar affect, were found in 56% of patients. Key features on neuroimaging include a thin corpus callosum (90%), ventriculomegaly (65%) often with colpocephaly, and periventricular white-matter signal abnormalities (68%). Iron deposition and polymicrogyria were found in a subset of patients. AP4B1-associated SPG47 and AP4M1-associated SPG50 accounted for the majority of cases. About two-thirds of patients were born to consanguineous parents, and 82% carried homozygous variants. Over 70 unique variants were present, the majority of which are frameshift or nonsense mutations. To track disease progression across the age spectrum, we defined the relationship between disease severity as measured by several rating scales and disease duration. We found that the presence of epilepsy, which manifested before the age of 3 years in the majority of patients, was associated with worse motor outcomes. Exploring genotype-phenotype correlations, we found that disease severity and major phenotypes were equally distributed among the four subtypes, establishing that SPG47, SPG50, SPG51 and SPG52 share a common phenotype, an 'AP-4 deficiency syndrome'. By delineating the core clinical, imaging, and molecular features of AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia across the age spectrum our results will facilitate early diagnosis, enable counselling and anticipatory guidance of affected families and help define endpoints for future interventional trials.","dc:creator":"Ebrahimi-Fakhari D","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Defining the clinical, molecular and imaging spectrum of adaptor protein complex 4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient105"},{"id":"cggv:d26f96d1-82f4-4af9-84f7-6ea0b2aa502e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d26f96d1-82f4-4af9-84f7-6ea0b2aa502e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"2 points were awarded based on the ID/autism expert group’s opinion that awarding 3 points for each case was too high and allowed for too few (only 4) cases to reach a definitive classification for AR conditions."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:81ca8d73-aa65-47c4-9ec9-cd49bebcd409_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:81ca8d73-aa65-47c4-9ec9-cd49bebcd409","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"cggv:e7d157f5-6d43-402d-b123-6ce913316514","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"XR_001751183.1(AP4E1):n.3229C>T (undefined)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA392422670"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0010864","obo:HP_0007020"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:e00a5819-f419-4c8d-870f-73a896299cd2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:e7d157f5-6d43-402d-b123-6ce913316514"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23472171","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We report identical twins with intellectual disability, progressive spastic paraplegia and short stature, born to a consanguineous family.

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation (p.R1105X) of the AP4E1 gene, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The p.R1105X mutation has no effect on AP4E1 mRNA levels, but results in lower levels of AP-4ε protein and of the other components of the AP-4 complex, as shown by western blotting, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. Thus, the C-terminal part of the AP-4ε subunit plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the AP-4 complex. No abnormalities of the IL-12/IFN-γ axis or oxidative burst pathways were identified. In conclusion, we identified twins with autosomal recessive AP-4 deficiency associated with HSP and mycobacterial disease, suggesting that AP-4 may play important role in the neurological and

disability inherited in an autosomal-recessive fashion represents an important fraction of severe cognitive-dysfunction disorders. Yet, the extreme heterogeneity of these conditions markedly hampers gene identification. Here, we report on eight affected individuals who were from three consanguineous families and presented with severe intellectual disability, absent speech, shy character, stereotypic laughter, muscular hypotonia that progressed to spastic paraplegia, microcephaly, foot deformity, decreased muscle mass of the lower limbs, inability to walk, and growth retardation. Using a combination of autozygosity mapping and either Sanger sequencing of candidate genes or next-generation exome sequencing, we identified one mutation in each of three genes encoding adaptor protein complex 4 (AP4) subunits: a nonsense mutation in AP4S1 (NM_007077.3: c.124C>T, p.Arg42(∗)), a frameshift mutation in AP4B1 (NM_006594.2: c.487_488insTAT, p.Glu163_Ser739delinsVal), and a splice mutation in AP4E1 (NM_007347.3: c.542+1_542+4delGTAA, r.421_542del, p.Glu181Glyfs(∗)20). Adaptor protein complexes (AP1-4) are ubiquitously expressed, evolutionarily conserved heterotetrameric complexes that mediate different types of vesicle formation and the selection of cargo molecules for inclusion into these vesicles. Interestingly, two mutations affecting AP4M1 and AP4E1 have recently been found to cause cerebral palsy associated with severe intellectual disability. Combined with previous observations, these results support the hypothesis that AP4-complex-mediated trafficking plays a crucial role in brain development and functioning and demonstrate the existence of a clinically recognizable syndrome due to deficiency of the AP4 complex.","dc:creator":"Abou Jamra R","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Adaptor protein complex 4 deficiency causes severe autosomal-recessive intellectual disability, progressive spastic paraplegia, shy character, and short stature."}},"rdfs:label":"III-5"},{"id":"cggv:edfb0676-576d-4102-bc15-a093ba41e34d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:edfb0676-576d-4102-bc15-a093ba41e34d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"2 points were awarded based on the ID/autism expert group’s opinion that awarding 3 points for each case was too high and allowed for too few (only 4) cases to reach a definitive classification for AR conditions."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1208ad61-e7ec-4bda-971f-66983e743987_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1208ad61-e7ec-4bda-971f-66983e743987","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:9032c50f-8a84-455c-85f9-af97e39c0be9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"AP4E1, VAL454FS","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/30661"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001258"],"secondTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:3c5fd109-4197-4703-b7f9-81b70543ba88_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9032c50f-8a84-455c-85f9-af97e39c0be9"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21937992","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Common diseases are often complex because they are genetically heterogeneous, with many different genetic defects giving rise to clinically indistinguishable phenotypes. This has been amply documented for early-onset cognitive impairment, or intellectual disability, one of the most complex disorders known and a very important health care problem worldwide. More than 90 different gene defects have been identified for X-chromosome-linked intellectual disability alone, but research into the more frequent autosomal forms of intellectual disability is still in its infancy. To expedite the molecular elucidation of autosomal-recessive intellectual disability, we have now performed homozygosity mapping, exon enrichment and next-generation sequencing in 136 consanguineous families with autosomal-recessive intellectual disability from Iran and elsewhere. This study, the largest published so far, has revealed additional mutations in 23 genes previously implicated in intellectual disability or related neurological disorders, as well as single, probably disease-causing variants in 50 novel candidate genes. Proteins encoded by several of these genes interact directly with products of known intellectual disability genes, and many are involved in fundamental cellular processes such as transcription and translation, cell-cycle control, energy metabolism and fatty-acid synthesis, which seem to be pivotal for normal brain development and function.","dc:creator":"Najmabadi H","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Deep sequencing reveals 50 novel genes for recessive cognitive disorders."}},"rdfs:label":"M254-1"},{"id":"cggv:3c5fd109-4197-4703-b7f9-81b70543ba88","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3c5fd109-4197-4703-b7f9-81b70543ba88_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"2 points were awarded based on the ID/autism expert group’s opinion that awarding 3 points for each case was too high and allowed for too few (only 4) cases to reach a definitive classification for AR conditions."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c0c9e9b7-3322-4eb5-a829-9ef55054e062_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c0c9e9b7-3322-4eb5-a829-9ef55054e062","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:b75feb43-3046-448a-ab0e-b5852ca1dafe","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_007347.5(AP4E1):c.944-1G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA392416547"}},"detectionMethod":"Exome sequencing, NGS panel sequencing, Sanger sequencing and microarray used","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001258","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0001250"],"secondTestingMethod":"Chromosomal microarray","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:60092255-e0c5-4a08-bef6-6951d33f4aef_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:b75feb43-3046-448a-ab0e-b5852ca1dafe"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32979048"},"rdfs:label":"Patient066"},{"id":"cggv:60092255-e0c5-4a08-bef6-6951d33f4aef","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:60092255-e0c5-4a08-bef6-6951d33f4aef_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"2 points were awarded based on the ID/autism expert group’s opinion that awarding 3 points for each case was too high and allowed for too few (only 4) cases to reach a definitive classification for AR conditions."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:be93d2e7-f302-41a7-9675-032510e46ad2_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be93d2e7-f302-41a7-9675-032510e46ad2_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d037491f-1860-419e-9dc9-107a7cc0a362","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d54b08d9-d1bc-4339-8072-654e011f1353","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"AP4E1 encodes a subunit of the adaptor protein 4 (AP4) complex; defects in the 3 other AP4 subunits (AP4B1, AP4M1 and AP4S1) result in the same clinical phenotype/condition (AP4 deficiency).

This study aims to evaluate the impact of loss-of-function variants in AP-4 subunits on intracellular protein trafficking using patient-derived cells. We investigated 15 patient-derived fibroblast lines and generated six lines of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons covering a wide range of AP-4 variants. All patient-derived fibroblasts showed reduced levels of the AP4E1 subunit, a surrogate for levels of the AP-4 complex. The autophagy protein ATG9A accumulated in the trans-Golgi network and was depleted from peripheral compartments. Western blot analysis demonstrated a 3-5-fold increase in ATG9A expression in patient lines. ATG9A was redistributed upon re-expression of AP4B1 arguing that mistrafficking of ATG9A is AP-4-dependent. Examining the downstream effects of ATG9A mislocalization, we found that autophagic flux was intact in patient-derived fibroblasts both under nutrient-rich conditions and when autophagy is stimulated. Mitochondrial metabolism and intracellular iron content remained unchanged. In iPSC-derived cortical neurons from patients with AP4B1-associated SPG47, AP-4 subunit levels were reduced while ATG9A accumulated in the trans-Golgi network. Levels of the autophagy marker LC3-II were reduced, suggesting a neuron-specific alteration in autophagosome turnover. Neurite outgrowth and branching were reduced in AP-4-HSP neurons pointing to a role of AP-4-mediated protein trafficking in neuronal development. Collectively, our results establish ATG9A mislocalization as a key marker of AP-4 deficiency in patient-derived cells, including the first human neuron model of AP-4-HSP, which will aid diagnostic and therapeutic studies.","dc:creator":"Behne R","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Adaptor protein complex 4 deficiency: a paradigm of childhood-onset hereditary spastic paraplegia caused by defective protein trafficking."},"rdfs:label":"Defective protein trafficking in AP4 deficiency patients"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:be93d2e7-f302-41a7-9675-032510e46ad2_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:88a84d06-5833-4886-b490-7d471ceb232b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:78122f67-cbcd-42a4-9428-fbacef121568","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Impaired motor coordination and weak grip strength seen in AP4E1 KO mice is consistent with impaired motor development, hypotonia and spastic paraplegia in humans\nThin corpus callosum found in AP4E1 KO mice is similar to thinning of corpus callosum in human patients. \nMislocalization of ATG9A (AP4 cargo) in AP4E1 KO mice is also seen in patient cells","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29698489","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by progressive lower limb spasticity. Mutations in subunits of the heterotetrameric (ε-β4-μ4-σ4) adaptor protein 4 (AP-4) complex cause an autosomal recessive form of complicated HSP referred to as \"AP-4 deficiency syndrome\". In addition to lower limb spasticity, this syndrome features intellectual disability, microcephaly, seizures, thin corpus callosum and upper limb spasticity. The pathogenetic mechanism, however, remains poorly understood. Here we report the characterization of a knockout (KO) mouse for the AP4E1 gene encoding the ε subunit of AP-4. We find that AP-4 ε KO mice exhibit a range of neurological phenotypes, including hindlimb clasping, decreased motor coordination and weak grip strength. In addition, AP-4 ε KO mice display a thin corpus callosum and axonal swellings in various areas of the brain and spinal cord. Immunohistochemical analyses show that the transmembrane autophagy-related protein 9A (ATG9A) is more concentrated in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and depleted from the peripheral cytoplasm both in skin fibroblasts from patients with mutations in the μ4 subunit of AP-4 and in various neuronal types in AP-4 ε KO mice. ATG9A mislocalization is associated with increased tendency to accumulate mutant huntingtin (HTT) aggregates in the axons of AP-4 ε KO neurons. These findings indicate that the AP-4 ε KO mouse is a suitable animal model for AP-4 deficiency syndrome, and that defective mobilization of ATG9A from the TGN and impaired autophagic degradation of protein aggregates might contribute to neuroaxonal dystrophy in this disorder.","dc:creator":"De Pace R","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Altered distribution of ATG9A and accumulation of axonal aggregates in neurons from a mouse model of AP-4 deficiency syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"AP4E1 Knockout mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8689,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"cggv:2e9de8e4-d726-4dde-a976-76c459d4f966","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100176","gene":"hgnc:573","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.3","dc:description":"AP4E1 loss-of-function variants have been reported in at least 21 individuals from 11 families with autosomal recessive Adaptor Protein 4 (AP4) deficiency syndrome (PMID: 32979048).
