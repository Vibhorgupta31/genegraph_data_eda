A positional cloning approach supported by bioinformatics identified PRPF31 comprising 14 exons and encoding a protein of 499 amino acids. The level of sequence identity to the yeast PRP31 gene indicates that PRPF31 is also likely to be involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Mutations that include missense substitutions, deletions, and insertions have been identified in four RP11-linked families and three sporadic RP cases. The identification of mutations in a pre-mRNA splicing gene implicates defects in the splicing process as a novel mechanism of photoreceptor degeneration.","dc:creator":"Vithana EN","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"A human homolog of yeast pre-mRNA splicing gene, PRP31, underlies autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa on chromosome 19q13.4 (RP11)."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:81f354cf-29c2-4955-a09d-735463f16a35_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:81f354cf-29c2-4955-a09d-735463f16a35_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bb12455a-aca6-4b14-816a-36cb37b9d282","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:39c474a0-c33d-4ff4-b493-d87ccd39c411","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"A significant difference in wild-type PRPF31 mRNA levels was observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (P < 0.001) and was supported by Western blot analysis of the PRPF31 protein.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14507862","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To investigate whether the incomplete penetrance phenotype characteristic of adRP families linked to chromosome 19q13.4 (RP11) with mutations in the PRPF31 gene is due to differentially expressed wild-type alleles in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.","dc:creator":"Vithana EN","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Expression of PRPF31 mRNA in patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa: a molecular clue for incomplete penetrance?"},"rdfs:label":"Expression analysis of PRPF31 mRNA"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:81f354cf-29c2-4955-a09d-735463f16a35_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1ca3d626-4816-4f77-902c-77503065353a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5654d4e8-7d08-4642-a85d-763cd7c35ab9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"This PRPF31 knockout mice showed late-onset degenerative changes in the RPE of the retina which is critical for photoreceptor structure and function.

To account for a spectrum of retinal phenotypes that may be caused by variants in this gene, and in accordance with the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidelines, the disease entity used for this curation is PRPF31-related retinopathy. This condition is characterized by night blindness (onset in teens), progressive visual loss, and blindness (onset in 30s).\n\nTen variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, complex rearrangement) that have been reported in 10 probands in 06 publications (PMIDs: 11545739, 12714658, 12923864, 23288994, 29375987, 20939871) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Interestingly, incomplete penetrance has been frequently observed in families with *PRPF31* pathogenic variants. There are over 200 *PRPF31* pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants listed on ClinVar (07/05/2022).\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be LOF. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional studies in patient derived organoids and retinal pigment epithelium, and *Prpf31+/-* mouse (PMIDs: 30315276, 20811066). \n\nIn summary, *PRPF31* is definitively associated with PRPF31-releated retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on July 7, 2022 (SOP v9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:81f354cf-29c2-4955-a09d-735463f16a35"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
