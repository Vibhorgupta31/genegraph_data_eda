It is reported here that the clinical and immunologic phenotypes of patients bearing mutations in RAGs are more diverse than previously thought and that this variability is related, in part, to the specific type of RAG mutation. By analyzing 44 such patients from 41 families, the following conclusions were reached: (1) null mutations on both alleles lead to the T-B-SCID phenotype; (2) patients manifesting classic Omenn syndrome (OS) have missense mutations on at least one allele and maintain partial V(D)J recombination activity, which accounts for the generation of residual, oligoclonal T-lymphocytes; (3) in a third group of patients, findings were only partially compatible with OS, and these patients, who also carried at least one missense mutation, may be considered to have atypical SCID/OS; (4) patients with engraftment of maternal T cells as a complication of a transplacental transfusion represented a fourth group, and these patients, who often presented with a clinical phenotype mimicking OS, may be observed regardless of the type of RAG gene mutation. Analysis of the RAG genes by direct sequencing is an effective way to provide accurate diagnosis of RAG-deficient as opposed to RAG-independent V(D)J recombination defects, a distinction that cannot be made based on clinical and immunologic phenotype alone.","dc:creator":"Villa A","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"V(D)J recombination defects in lymphocytes due to RAG mutations: severe immunodeficiency with a spectrum of clinical presentations."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:a2b5f109-7b29-463d-bb35-9e38198d5606","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a2b5f109-7b29-463d-bb35-9e38198d5606_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The homozygous Trp307Ter variant was identified in one T-B- SCID patient.

In addition identification of hypomorphic mutations in RAG1 and RAG2 has led to an expansion of the spectrum of disease to include Omenn syndrome, early onset autoimmunity, granuloma, chronic cytomegalovirus- or EBV-infection with expansion of gamma/delta T-cells, idiophatic CD4 lymphopenia and a phenotype resembling common variable immunodeficiency. Herein we describe a novel presentation of leaky RAG1 and RAG2 deficiency in two unrelated adult patients with impaired antibody production against bacterial polysaccharide antigens. Clinical manifestation included recurrent pneumonia, sinusitis, otitis media and in one patient recurrent cutaneous vasculitis. Both patients harbored a combination of a null mutation on one allele with a novel hypomorphic RAG1/2 mutation on the other allele. One of these novel mutations affected the start codon of RAG1 and resulted in an aberrant gene and protein expression. The second novel RAG2 mutation leads to a truncated RAG2 protein, lacking the C-terminus with intact core RAG2 and reduced VDJ recombination capacity as previously described in a mouse model. Both patients presented with severely decreased numbers of naïve CD4+ T cells and defective T independent IgG responses to bacterial polysaccharide antigens, while T cell-dependent IgG antibody formation e.g. after tetanus or TBEV vaccination was intact. In conclusion, hypomorphic mutations in genes responsible for SCID should be considered in adults with predominantly antibody deficiency.","dc:creator":"Geier CB","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Leaky RAG Deficiency in Adult Patients with Impaired Antibody Production against Bacterial Polysaccharide Antigens."}},{"id":"cggv:ac76416e-bea9-42ec-86c8-7d328e10365d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f05de0f1-df7e-4123-98bf-dc479658cadc"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26186701"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient B"},{"id":"cggv:59eb084a-76f0-4fc1-ac52-fb3456b65b66","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:59eb084a-76f0-4fc1-ac52-fb3456b65b66_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"It occurs at a HMAF of 0.00002638 in the gnomAD European population."},{"id":"cggv:ac76416e-bea9-42ec-86c8-7d328e10365d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ac76416e-bea9-42ec-86c8-7d328e10365d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Ser381Ter occurs in exon 2of 2 and is expected to cause truncation of 28% of the protein.

RAG2 encodes recombination-activating gene 2, which is involved in V(D)J recombination and with RAG1 introduces double-stranded breaks between recombination signal sequences and coding segments. In RAG2-deficient individuals, V(D)J recombination is blocked such that mature B and T cells are not produced, leading to T-B- SCID which typically presents in infancy with recurrent, persistent infections by opportunistic organisms. Biallelic loss of function variants as associated with a SCID presentation, while hypomorphic alleles may lead to Leaky SCID with the presence of some mature T-cells. Omenn Syndrome -- characterized by SCID associated with erythroderma, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and alopecia -- is one presentation of Leaky SCID. SCID, Leaky SCID and Omenn Syndrome are considered a spectrum of a single disease, and per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern.  Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, RAG2 deficiency. Generally, heterozygous parents/carriers are clinically unaffected. Over 100 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, and large deletion) have been reported in humans. Curated evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship includes 15 probands with RAG2 variants who have been reported in 5 publications (PMIDs: 8810255, 11133745, 19912631, 26186701, 12200379). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including its biochemical function in V(D)J recombination (PMID: 8521468), which is altered in cell lines expressing RAG2 variants (PMID: 12200379). Additionally, RAG2 interacts with RAG1 (PMID: 8777717) which causes a similar phenotype and RAG2 expression is generally restricted in lymphocytes (PMID: 25613900). Furthermore, animal models recapitulate the spectrum of disease with Omenn syndrome (PMID: 17476358) and T-B- SCID (PMID: 11547487) phenotypes. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence has been reached. In summary, RAG2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive RAG2 deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID/CID Working Group on 08/19/2021.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4e9918ba-b94a-4526-bd99-09abef894225"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
