Here, we have generated a mouse model for the peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4H by constitutively disrupting the mouse orthologue of the suspected culprit gene FGD4 that encodes the small RhoGTPase Cdc42-guanine nucleotide exchange factor Frabin. Lack of Frabin/Fgd4 causes dysmyelination in mice in early peripheral nerve development, followed by profound myelin abnormalities and demyelination at later stages. At the age of 60 weeks, this was accompanied by electrophysiological deficits. By crossing mice carrying alleles of Frabin/Fgd4 flanked by loxP sequences with animals expressing Cre recombinase in a cell type-specific manner, we show that Schwann cell-autonomous Frabin/Fgd4 function is essential for proper myelination without detectable primary contributions from neurons. Deletion of Frabin/Fgd4 in Schwann cells of fully myelinated nerve fibres revealed that this protein is not only required for correct nerve development but also for accurate myelin maintenance. Moreover, we established that correct activation of Cdc42 is dependent on Frabin/Fgd4 function in healthy peripheral nerves. Genetic disruption of Cdc42 in Schwann cells of adult myelinated nerves resulted in myelin alterations similar to those observed in Frabin/Fgd4-deficient mice, indicating that Cdc42 and the Frabin/Fgd4-Cdc42 axis are critical for myelin homeostasis. In line with known regulatory roles of Cdc42, we found that Frabin/Fgd4 regulates Schwann cell endocytosis, a process that is increasingly recognized as a relevant mechanism in peripheral nerve pathophysiology. Taken together, our results indicate that regulation of Cdc42 by Frabin/Fgd4 in Schwann cells is critical for the structure and function of the peripheral nervous system. In particular, this regulatory link is continuously required in adult fully myelinated nerve fibres. Thus, mechanisms regulated by Frabin/Fgd4-Cdc42 are promising targets that can help to identify additional regulators of myelin development and homeostasis, which may crucially contribute also to malfunctions in different types of peripheral neuropathies.","dc:creator":"Horn M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Myelin is dependent on the Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 4H disease culprit protein FRABIN/FGD4 in Schwann cells."},"rdfs:label":"Frabin/Fgd4 regulates endocytosis in Schwann cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:e0aae8cd-9d57-4d8c-83ae-ed968cf186bc_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4c7d5cee-bc4a-4cbb-b7a7-b1ee7b910d7b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:38e320c8-4dc6-4350-ae55-9da32b0859e6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Western blot of Fgd4 -/- (null) mice sciatic nerve lysates show lack of Fgd4 protein expression (Fig. 1B), null mice were viable and had not major abnormal behavior by SHIRPA analysis up to 60wks of age, mice had normal body size and weight (Supplementary Table S1), grip strength test at 60wks showed null mice have mildly impaired performance compared to WT mice, null mice at 60wks had increased distal latencies and increased F-wave latencies, reduced nerve conduction velocity, and dispersed compound muscle action potentials with reduced amplitude compared to WT (Fig. 1C,D).

At least 32 unique variants, including missense, nonsense, splice, frameshift, and indels have been reported in humans (Delague et al., 2007; PMID:17564959, Stendel et al., 2007; PMID:17564972, databases the Inherited Neuropathy Variant Database, LOVD, and HGMD) This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies and animal models. Investigation determined that FGD4 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissue, and was found to have the highest levels of expression in mouse nerve tissue during the embryonic stage. Additionally, mice with a disruption of FGD4 were found to have dysmyelination in early nerve development and additional myelin abnormalities at later stages of development. Frabin is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for CDC42, and deleting Fdg4 or Cdc42 in Schwann cells results in a similar defect in myelination, showing that these two genes have an essential function in myelinating Schwann cells. In transfected cells, C-terminal truncations of frabin result in fewer microspikes, which could be a biological assay for investigating FDG4 variants.  In summary, FGD4 is DEFINITIVELY  associated with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e0aae8cd-9d57-4d8c-83ae-ed968cf186bc"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
