Data were collected on an Arndt-Wonacott camera at -2 degrees C. The structure was refined to an R factor of 0.223 by the Jack-Levitt method, starting from Baldwin's model of human carbon monoxide haemoglobin. The active sites in the alpha and beta subunit are distinct. The iron atoms are 0.16(8) A and 0.00(8) A from the mean plane of the porphyrin carbons and nitrogens (0.12(8) A and -0.11(8) A from the mean plane of the porphyrin nitrogens) in the alpha and beta subunit, respectively, in correlation with the orientation of HisF8 relative to the porphyrin nitrogens. The haem group appears to be nearly planar in the alpha subunit but ruffled in the beta subunit. The Fe-O(1)-O(2) angles are 153(7) degrees and 159(12) degrees in the alpha and beta subunit, respectively. The oxygen molecule forms a hydrogen bond to N epsilon of HisE7 in the alpha, but either none or a weak one in the beta subunit. The following bond lengths were found: Fe-N epsilon (HisF8) = 1.94(9) A (alpha) and 2.07(9) A (beta); Fe-O(1) = 1.66(8) A (alpha) and 1.87(13) A (beta); Fe-Nporph (mean = 1.99(5) A (alpha) and 1.96(6) A (beta). These dimensions agree with the values obtained in oxymyoglobin and model compounds. The C-terminal residues, ArgHC3(141 alpha) and HisHC3(146 beta), are relatively delocalized, and their positions do not enable them to form the intersubunit salt bridges in which they are involved in deoxyhaemoglobin. The penultimate tyrosine residues, TyrHC2 140 alpha and 145 beta, are relatively localized and maintain the hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygens of ValFG5 (93 alpha and 98 beta), with only minor variations compared to their geometry in deoxyhaemoglobin. TyrHC2(145 beta), however, alternates between a major and a minor site, in conjunction with CysF9(93 beta), both sharing the internal pocket between the F and H helices while in the major conformation. This suggests that the role of the penultimate tyrosines in the allosteric mechanism may differ from that previously proposed by Perutz. The overall quaternary structure of oxyhaemoglobin is identical, within experimental error, to that of carbon monoxide haemoglobin, and thus confirms the applicability of the allosteric mechanisms proposed by Perutz and Baldwin & Chothia to the process of oxygen binding.","dc:creator":"Shaanan B","dc:date":"1983","dc:title":"Structure of human oxyhaemoglobin at 2.1 A resolution."},"rdfs:label":"HBB physically interacts with the HBA1/HBA2 gene product."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The interaction of HBB with alpha-hemoglobin links it physically with the protein product of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes.

This results in an additional 73-nucleotide exon between exons 2 and 3 and leads to a severe thalassemia syndrome. Herein, we explored a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing approach to eliminate the additional 73- nucleotide by targeting both the IVS-2-654 C→T and a cryptic acceptor splice site at IVS-2-579 in order to correct aberrant b-globin RNA splicing and ameliorate the clinical β-thalassemia syndrome in β654 mice. Gene-edited mice were generated by microinjection of sgRNA and Cas9 mRNA into one-cell embryos of β654 or control mice: 83.3% of live-born mice were gene-edited, 70% of which produced correctly spliced RNA. No off-target events were observed. The clinical symptoms, including hematologic parameters and tissue pathology of all of the edited β654 founders and their offspring were significantly improved compared to those of the non-edited β654 mice, consistent with the restoration of wild-type b-globin RNA expression. Notably, the survival rate of gene-edited heterozygous β654 mice increased significantly, and liveborn homozygous β654 mice were observed.

The allele frequency of alpha+ thalassaemia was 6.5% and 1.1% for -alpha3.7 and -alpha4.2 deletions respectively. Non-deletion alpha-thalassaemia was not observed. Triplicate or quadruplicate alpha-globin genes were unusually common. In 1.5% of cases it was impossible to identify beta-thalassaemia alleles, but in Kurunegala detailed family studies led to an explanation for the severe thalassaemia phenotype in every case, including a previously unreported instance of homozygosity for a quadruplicated alpha-globin gene together with beta-thalassaemia trait.

These recessive disorders occur with high frequency among populations that have historically inhabited parts of the world where malaria is endemic. The inherited basis was first traced to partial or complete deletions in the *HBB* locus encoding the hemoglobin beta chain in 1975 (Ottolenghi et al., PMID: 49057), followed by the identification of specific HBB variants in two subsequent studies (PMID: 88735, PMID: 287080). Please note that earlier publications had previously identified the molecular basis of beta-thalassemia at the protein level through sequencing of the HBB gene product (PMID: 5863839, PMID: 6025643, PMID: 6038175). Individuals with biallelic *HBB* disruption are generally diagnosed with beta-thalassemia major or beta-thalassemia intermedia, depending on severity. Genotype is strongly correlated with phenotype, with higher severity associated with absence of detectable beta chains (beta-zero-thalassemia), and milder cases associated with the persistence of some detectable beta globin (beta-plus-thalassemia). Less severe forms of disease can also have milder anemia, due to moderately increased HbA2 hemoglobin and persistence of hemoglobin F, and reduced or no dependency on transfusions. The clinical and laboratory features of severely affected individuals include erythrocyte abnormalities such as hypochromic microcytic anemia, anisopoikilocytosis, elliptocytosis, decreased mean corpuscular volume, basophilic stippling, and dependence on blood transfusions with many disease phenotypes secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis, e.g. splenomegaly and chronic transfusions resulting in iron overload. Characteristic abnormalities in hemoglobin itself include lack of beta-hemoglobin production, reduced hemoglobin A, increased HbA2 hemoglobin, and persistence of hemoglobin F later into childhood. Heterozygous carriers of causal variants are referred to as having beta-thalassemia minor or beta-thalassemia trait and can be mildly or sub-clinically affected. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the molecular mechanism has been found to be consistent between cases harboring biallelic and monoallelic loss-of-function variants in *HBB*. However, the dramatic difference in phenotypic severity and penetrance between the biallelic and monoallelic cases distinguishes them as two different conditions rather than a single spectrum of disease. Therefore, cases of beta-thalassemia major or beta-thalassemia intermedia caused by biallelic *HBB* variants have been separately curated here for beta-thalassemia HBB/LCRB (MONDO:0013517). Cases of beta-thalassemia caused by dominant *HBB* variants in the heterozygous state have been found to cause disease through a different mechanism, and have been evaluated for dominant beta thalassemia (MONDO:0011381, MIM #603902) in a separate curation.\n\nTen suspected disease-causing variants have been scored as part of this curation (one missense, two nonsense, three frameshift, two disrupting splicing, one partial gene deletion, and one disrupting the first nucleotide of the 5’ UTR). These have been collectively reported in nine probands in four publications (PMID: 88735, PMID: 1581247, PMID: 287080, PMID: 3683554, PMID: 18196920, PMID: 12752111, PMID: 27263053). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of *HBB* function conferred by null and/or hypomorphic variants. Six out of nine probands were homozygous for their respective variants, while three probands were compound heterozygous. It has been established that the phenotype can also result from variants that disrupt a critical enhancer upstream of the *HBB* coding region (PMID: 1689188, PMID: 93487), although some of these variants disrupt the *HBD* locus as well. Evidence that the phenotype co-segregates with the homozygous genotype in a large family also contributed to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship (PMID: 18196920). A large amount of additional case-level evidence is available in the literature but was not included in this curation as the maximum score for this category of evidence had already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that the expression pattern of *HBB* across human tissues is highly restricted to the blood (PMID: 23715323). Extensive biochemical studies indicate that *HBB* encodes the beta chain of hemoglobin, which binds and releases oxygen as part of its function central to the role of red blood cells in carrying oxygen to the tissues of the body (PMID: 11747442). HBB protein interacts with the alpha hemoglobin chain encoded by the *HBA1* and *HBA2* genes (PMID: 6644819), which can harbor variants associated with the closely related condition alpha-thalassemia. Mouse models of *Hbb* loss of function recapitulate features of human beta-thalassemia patients such as hypochromic microcytic anemia, reduced hemoglobin A, abnormal erythrocyte morphology, splenomegaly, reticulocytosis, Heinz bodies, anisopoikilocytosis, presence of target cells, bone marrow hypercellularity, and abnormal iron deposition (PMID: 7568113, PMID: 9490703). CRISPR/Cas9-based editing of the mouse mutation in one case resulted in significant rescue of anemia, low hemoglobin concentration, anisocytosis and poikilocytosis, bone marrow proliferation, iron accumulation, and splenomegaly (PMID: 34706494).\n\nIn summary, *HBB* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of beta-thalassemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 26th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:10e10aac-d9cc-4422-8fb9-b206e642bb27"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
