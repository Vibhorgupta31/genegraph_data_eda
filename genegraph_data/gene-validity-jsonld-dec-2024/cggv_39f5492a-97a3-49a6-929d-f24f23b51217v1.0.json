The DGI1 locus was recently refined to a 2-Mb interval on 4q21 (ref. 1). Here we study three Chinese families carrying DGI1. We find that the affected individuals of two families also presented with progressive sensorineural high-frequency hearing loss (gene DFNA39). We identified three disease-specific mutations within the dentin sialophosphoprotein gene (DSPP) in these three families. We detected a G-->A transition at the donor-splicing site of intron 3 in one family without DFNA39, a mutation predicted to result in the skipping of exon 3. In two other families affected with both DGI1 and DFNA39, however, we identified two independent nucleotide transversions in exons 2 and 3 of DSPP, respectively, that cause missense mutations of two adjacent amino-acid residues in the predicted transmembrane region of the protein. Moreover, transcripts of DSPP previously reported to be expressed specifically in teeth are also detected in the inner ear of mice. We have thus demonstrated for the first time that distinct mutations in DSPP are responsible for the clinical manifestations of DGI1 with or without DFNA39.","dc:creator":"Xiao S","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Dentinogenesis imperfecta 1 with or without progressive hearing loss is associated with distinct mutations in DSPP."},"rdfs:label":"Xiao Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:39f5492a-97a3-49a6-929d-f24f23b51217_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c8ff1773-bf88-4fc0-ab01-0318ff6115b4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d8b83934-6314-4170-822e-ad81df8e6b17","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The c.50C>T (p.P17L) variant does not interfere with normal pre-mRNA splicing, but mutant DSP was shown by fluorescent immunocytochemistry to be localized throughout the cytoplasm.

In this study, we identified a Korean family with dentinogenesis imperfecta type III. To identify the disease causing mutation in this family, we performed mutational analysis based on candidate gene sequencing. Exons and exon-intron boundaries of DSPP gene were sequenced, and the effects of the identified mutation on the pre-mRNA splicing and protein secretion were investigated. Candidate gene sequencing revealed a mutation (c.50C > T, p.P17L) in exon 2 of the DSPP gene. The splicing assay showed that the mutation did not influence pre-mRNA splicing. However, the mutation interfered with protein secretion and resulted in the mutant protein remaining largely in the ER.

Electron microscopy revealed an irregular mineralization front and a lack of calcospherites coalescence in the dentin. Interestingly, the levels of biglycan and decorin, small leucine-rich proteoglycans, were increased in the widened predentin zone and in void spaces among the calcospherites in the dentin of null teeth. These enhanced levels correlate well with the defective regions in mineralization and further indicate that these molecules may adversely affect the dentin mineralization process by interfering with coalescence of calcospherites.

However, whether DGI type III should be considered a distinct phenotype or a variation of DGI type II is debatable. In the 30 years since the classification system was first proposed, significant advances have been made regarding the genetic etiologies of inherited dentin defects. DGI type II is recognized as an autosomal dominant disorder with almost complete penetrance and a low frequency of de novo mutations. We have identified a mutation (c.52G-->T, p.V18F) at the first nucleotide of exon 3 of the DSPP (dentin sialophosphoprotein) gene in a Korean family (de novo) and a Caucasian family. This mutation has previously been reported as causing DGI type II in a Chinese family. These findings suggest that this mutation site represents a mutational \"hot spot\" in the DSPP gene. The clinical and radiographic features of these two families include the classic phenotypes associated with both DGI type II and type III. Finding that a single mutation causes both phenotypic patterns strongly supports the conclusion that DGI type II and DGI type III are not separate diseases but rather the phenotypic variation of a single disease.

Defects in the human gene encoding DSPP cause inherited dentin defects, and these defects can be associated with bilateral progressive high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Clinically, five different patterns of inherited dentin defects are distinguished and are classified as dentinogenesis imperfecta (DGI) types I, II, and III, and dentin dysplasia types I and II. The genetic basis for this clinical heterogeneity is unknown. Among the 11 members recruited from the studied kindred, five were affected with autosomal dominant DGI type II. The mutation (g.1188C-->G, IVS2-3C-->G) lay in the third from the last nucleotide of intron 2 and changed its sequence from CAG to GAG. The mutation was correlated with the affection status and was absent in 104 unaffected individuals (208 alleles) with the same ethnic and geological background. The proband was in the primary dentition stage and presented with multiple pulp exposures. The occlusal surface of his dental enamel was generally abraded, and the dentin was heavily worn and uniformly shaded brown. The dental pulp chambers appeared originally to be within normal limits without any sign of obliteration, but over time (by age 4), the pulp chambers became partially or completely obliterated. The oldest affected member (age 59) showed mild hearing loss at high-frequency (8 kHz). Permanent dentition was severely affected in the adults, who had advanced dental attrition, premature loss of teeth, and extensive dental reconstruction.","dc:creator":"Kim JW","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"A novel splice acceptor mutation in the DSPP gene causing dentinogenesis imperfecta type II."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15241678","rdfs:label":"Kim Family Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded because candidate sequencing of DSPP does not rule out other genes as causative."},{"id":"cggv:484122c1-7af3-42d7-907a-c87cc694bff5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8dba9937-109b-493c-b592-37c5774e049f","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:484122c1-7af3-42d7-907a-c87cc694bff5_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:12f9e39e-d18c-4ec4-8fb7-6f11d601e3f9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014208.3(DSPP):c.2684del (p.Ser895MetfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA658820912"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18456718"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18456718","rdfs:label":"Family S Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantNullVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":7},{"id":"cggv:39f5492a-97a3-49a6-929d-f24f23b51217_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1023f0ce-0d53-4958-9396-e58d68837565_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:33012052-9939-4170-95b7-843d275812d3","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"PCR in proband, SSCP of family members, and paternity testing","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:1023f0ce-0d53-4958-9396-e58d68837565_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:93881015-cc3c-48e9-b961-a3e0b71feeec"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15592686"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15592686","rdfs:label":"Proband 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"This variant arose de novo in the proband, and paternity was confirmed.

This association was made using case-level data. At least 8​ variants (missense, frameshift, splice-site) have been reported in humans. DSPP was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2001 (Xiao et al.​). Association is seen in at least 11 probands in 6 publications (11175790, 15690376, 17686168, 15592686, 18456718, 15241678). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 52 additional family members.  Multiple unrelated families presented with variants at the last position of exon 2 (p.Phe17) or the first position of exon 3 (p.Val18). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Of note, only two families reported by Xiao et al. 2001 had an adult onset progressive high frequency hearing loss, therefore the hearing phenotype was lumped with the dentinogenesis imperfecta syndrome. This gene-disease association is supported by a homozygous DSPP null mouse model with dentinogenesis imperfecta phenotypes, as well as in vitro functional assays. In summary, DSPP is definitively associated with autosomal dominant dentinogenesis imperfecta. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss​ Working Group on 4/17/18.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:39f5492a-97a3-49a6-929d-f24f23b51217"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
