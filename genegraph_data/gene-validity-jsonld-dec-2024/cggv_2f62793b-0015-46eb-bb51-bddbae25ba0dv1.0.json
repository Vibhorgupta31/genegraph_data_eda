The sarcomeric protein actin plays a central, dual role in cardiac myocytes, generating contractile force by interacting with myosin and also transmitting force within and between cells. Two missense mutations in the cardiac actin gene (ACTC), postulated to impair force transmission, have been associated with familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Recently, a missense mutation in ACTC was found to cosegregate with familial HCM. To further test the hypothesis that mutations within functionally distinct domains of ACTC cause either DCM or HCM, we performed mutational analyses in 368 unrelated patients with familial or sporadic HCM. Single strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analyses of genomic DNA were performed. De novo mutations in ACTC were identified in two patients with sporadic HCM who presented with syncope in early childhood. Patients were heterozygous for missense mutations resulting in Pro164Ala and Ala331Pro amino acid substitutions, adjacent to regions of actin-actin and actin-myosin interaction, respectively. A mutation that cosegregated with familial HCM was also found, causing a Glu99Lys substitution in a weak actomyosin binding domain. The cardiac phenotype in many affected patients was characterized by an apical form of HCM.

We examined the biochemical and cell biological properties of the α-cardiac actin mutations Y166C and M305L identified in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Untagged wild-type (WT) cardiac actin, and the Y166C and M305L mutants were expressed by the baculovirus/Sf9-cell system and affinity purified by immobilized gelsolin G4-6. Their correct folding was verified by a number of assays. The mutant actins also displayed a disturbed intrinsic ATPase activity and an altered polymerization behavior in the presence of tropomyosin, gelsolin, and Arp2/3 complex. Both mutants stimulated the cardiac β-myosin ATPase to only 50 % of WT cardiac F-actin. Copolymers of WT and increasing amounts of the mutant actins led to a reduced stimulation of the myosin ATPase. Transfection of established cell lines revealed incorporation of EGFP- and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged WT and both mutant actins into cytoplasmic stress fibers. Adenoviral vectors of HA-tagged WT and Y166C actin were successfully used to infect adult and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCs). The expressed HA-tagged actins were incorporated into the minus-ends of NRC thin filaments, demonstrating the ability to form hybrid thin filaments with endogenous actin. In NRCs, the Y166C mutant led after 72 h to a shortening of the sarcomere length when compared to NRCs infected with WT actin. Thus our data demonstrate that a mutant actin can be integrated into cardiomyocyte thin filaments and by its reduced mode of myosin interaction might be the basis for the initiation of HCM.","dc:creator":"Müller M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Functional characterization of the human α-cardiac actin mutations Y166C and M305L involved in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."},"rdfs:label":"Müller 2012 Functional Alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The correct nomenclature for these variants is unclear and they are not currently in ClinVar or gnomAD.

Four unique variants (missense) with convincing evidence of pathogenicity have been reported in humans, including de novo inheritance with maternity and paternity confirmed in two cases and segregation with disease in 26 additional family members. ACTC1 was first associated with this disease in humans in 1999 (Mogensen et al, PMID 10330430). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is unknown. The ACTC1 gene was significantly enriched for missense variants in Walsh et al, 2016 (PMID 27532257). Overall, the gene was found to have an Odds Ratio of 8.59 (5.06-14.5) for HCM. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and an animal model. In summary, ACTC1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant HCM. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Expert Panel and was approved on September 5, 2017 using SOP version 5. It was reevaluated on June 23, 2021. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change and no additional evidence has been added.
