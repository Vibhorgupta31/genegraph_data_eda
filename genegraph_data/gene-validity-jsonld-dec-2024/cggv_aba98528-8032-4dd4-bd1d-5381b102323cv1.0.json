In bone marrow of individuals with reticular dysgenesis, myeloid differentiation is blocked at the promyelocytic stage, whereas erythro- and megakaryocytic maturation is generally normal. These features exclude a defect in hematopoietic stem cells but point to a unique aberration of the myelo-lymphoid lineages. The dramatic clinical course of reticular dysgenesis and its unique hematological phenotype have spurred interest in the unknown genetic basis of this syndrome. Here we show that the gene encoding the mitochondrial energy metabolism enzyme adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) is mutated in individuals with reticular dysgenesis. Knockdown of zebrafish ak2 also leads to aberrant leukocyte development, stressing the evolutionarily conserved role of AK2. Our results provide in vivo evidence for AK2 selectivity in leukocyte differentiation.

RD is characterized by a maturation arrest in the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, leading to early onset, recurrent, and overwhelming infections. To gain insight into the pathophysiology of RD, we studied the effects of AK2 deficiency using the zebrafish model and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from fibroblasts of an RD patient. In zebrafish, Ak2 deficiency affected hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development with increased oxidative stress and apoptosis.

Antioxidant treatment rescued the hematopoietic phenotypes in vivo in ak2 mutant zebrafish and restored differentiation of AK2-deficient iPSCs into mature granulocytes.

AK2 encodes adenylate kinase 2, a mitochondrial protein involved in regulating the adenine nucleotide composition within a cell by catalyzing the reversible transfer of the terminal phosphate group between ATP and AMP. It plays an important role in cellular energy homeostasis and in adenine nucleotide metabolism, particularly within the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, as well as in the stria vascularis of the inner ear, where AK1 isozyme expression is absent or low (PMIDs: 19043417, 19043416). Impairment of AK2 activity in humans leads to the severe lymphocyte and granulocyte differentiation defects and sensorineural deafness characteristic for reticular dysgenesis. Biallelic loss of function variants as associated with a SCID presentation, while hypomorphic alleles may lead to less severe presentations (PMID: 31862378). Curated evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship includes 9 probands with AK2 variants who have been reported in 2 publications (PMIDs: 19043417, 19043416). Clinically unaffected parents were confirmed heterozygous for AK2 variants, immunological phenotypes of carriers were not assessed. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including its biochemical function in energy metabolism (PMID: 6182143), which is altered by shRNA knockdown in non-patient cells (PMID: 26270350), and in patient cells (PMID: 19043417), but can be rescued by wild type in patient cells (PMID: 19043416). Models have been used to recapitulate the profound impairment of lymphoid and myeloid development in iPS cells or zebrafish (PMID: 26150473). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. In summary, AK2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive reticular dysgenesis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
