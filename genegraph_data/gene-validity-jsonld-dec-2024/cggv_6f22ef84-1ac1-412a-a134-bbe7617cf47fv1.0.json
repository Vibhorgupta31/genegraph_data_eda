No genetic evidence linking *NFATC2 *was identified in the literature or elsewhere. Genetic cases of *NFATC2* were seen to be a player in the congenital heart defects in patients with the 20q13.2 duplication along with* SALL4*(PMID: 24486774). \n\nFunctional alteration experimental evidence analyzed the mRNA levels in candidate CHD genes in the right ventricular myocardium of TOF cases and normal controls. Evidence found that  higher methylation of *NFATC2* might constitute a CpG island methylator phenotype for TOF disease (PMID: 24479926). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *NFATC2* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *NFATC2* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date March 11th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\nMore evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role NFATC2 plays in this disease.
