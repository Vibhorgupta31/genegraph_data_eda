More recently, mutations in the SIL1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum resident co-chaperone, were identified as the main cause of Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome. Here we describe the results of SIL1 mutation analysis in 62 patients presenting with early-onset ataxia, cataracts and myopathy or combinations of at least two of these. We obtained a mutation detection rate of 60% (15/25) among patients with the characteristic Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome triad (ataxia, cataracts, myopathy) whereas the detection rate in the group of patients with more variable phenotypic presentation was below 3% (1/37). We report 16 unrelated families with a total of 19 different SIL1 mutations. Among these mutations are 15 previously unreported changes, including single- and multi-exon deletions. Based on data from our screening cohort and data compiled from the literature we found that SIL1 mutations are invariably associated with the combination of a cerebellar syndrome and chronic myopathy. Cataracts were observed in all patients beyond the age of 7 years, but might be missing in infants. Six patients with SIL1 mutations had no intellectual disability, extending the known wide range of cognitive capabilities in Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome to include normal intelligence. Modestly constant features were somatic growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities and pyramidal tract signs. Examination of mutant SIL1 expression in cultured patient lymphoblasts suggested that SIL1 mutations result in severely reduced SIL1 protein levels irrespective of the type and position of mutations. Our data broaden the SIL1 mutation spectrum and confirm that SIL1 is the major Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome gene. SIL1 patients usually present with the characteristic triad but cataracts might be missing in young children. As cognitive impairment is not obligatory, patients without intellectual disability but a Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome-compatible phenotype should receive SIL1 mutation analysis. Despite allelic heterogeneity and many families with private mutations, the phenotype related to SIL1 mutations is relatively homogenous. Based on SIL1 expression studies we speculate that this may arise from a uniform effect of different mutations on protein expression.","dc:creator":"Krieger M","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"SIL1 mutations and clinical spectrum in patients with Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"Krieger 2013: MSS24.1"},{"id":"cggv:a159aab5-82d5-40bb-850d-0db8d74aabc2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a159aab5-82d5-40bb-850d-0db8d74aabc2_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:a159aab5-82d5-40bb-850d-0db8d74aabc2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"When expressed in HEK293 cells, the protein was shown to be unstable (band was absent on W blot, Fig 2A), and there was no homodimerization (compared to wild type, which homodimerizes, Fig 2E).

Recently, mutations in the SIL1 gene, encoding a co-chaperone which regulates the chaperone HSPA5, were identified as a major cause of MSS. We here examined the pathophysiological significance of SIL1 mutations in abnormal corticogenesis of MSS. SIL1-silencing caused neuronal migration delay during corticogenesis ex vivo. While RNAi-resistant SIL1 rescued the defects, three MSS-causing SIL1 mutants tested did not. These mutants had lower affinities to HSPA5 in vitro, and SIL1-HSPA5 interaction as well as HSPA5 function was found to be crucial for neuronal migration ex vivo. Furthermore time-lapse imaging revealed morphological disorganization associated with abnormal migration of SIL1-deficient neurons. These results suggest that the mutations prevent SIL1 from interacting with and regulating HSPA5, leading to abnormal neuronal morphology and migration. Consistent with this, when SIL1 was silenced in cortical neurons in one hemisphere, axonal growth in the contralateral hemisphere was delayed. Taken together, abnormal neuronal migration and interhemispheric axon development may contribute to MR in MSS.","dc:creator":"Inaguma Y","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"SIL1, a causative cochaperone gene of Marinesco-Söjgren syndrome, plays an essential role in establishing the architecture of the developing cerebral cortex."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue of mouse cortical migration defect with hSIL1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The score is reduced because this study focusses on only one aspect of the MSS phenotype.

We evaluated the motor function of homozygous and heterozygous wz mice aged from 5 to 71 weeks. Motor function was evaluated using the rotarod test, the footprint test, and the parallel rod floor test. Furthermore, we carried out a histopathological analysis of the mice at several ages. Impairment of motor function in homozygous wz mice began at around 11 weeks of age and became markedly worse until around 14 weeks. Heterozygous wz mice did not show motor dysfunction until 71 weeks of age. Features of cerebellar ataxia were evaluated using the footprint test and the parallel rod floor test. In addition to the observation of ubiquitin-positive aggregates at 6 weeks of age, Purkinje cell loss at 9 weeks of age and cerebellar atrophy were confirmed by histopathology. Apart from the cerebellar changes, we detected no other pathology that could contribute toward ataxia. In heterozygous wz mice, only minimal formation of ubiquitin-positive aggregates was observed. Homozygous wz mice showed adult-onset ataxia with progressive neurodegeneration of the cerebellum.

MSS is a multisystem disorder that is characterized by cerebellar dysfunction and ataxia, early-onset bilateral cataracts, developmental delays, intellectual disability, skeletal deformities, short stature and progressive myopathy (Anttonen, 2019, PMID: 20301371; Chiesa and Sallese, 2020, PMID: 31701543; Ichhaporia and Hendershot, 2021, PMID: 33557244). MSS is the only disorder known to be caused by variants in SIL1. \n\nSIL1 encodes an adenine nucleotide exchange factor for the ER homologue of Hsp (heat shock protein) 70 family, also known as BiP, HSPA5, or GRP78. Recent reviews discuss the role of SIL1 in the ER, and indicate that lack of SIL1 results in accumulation of unfolded proteins within the ER, providing a pathogenic mechanism for the features of MSS (Chiesa and Sallese, 2020, PMID: 31701543; Ichhaporia and Hendershot, 2021, PMID: 33557244).\n\nOver 40 MSS-associated variants have been reported in SIL1, including nonsense, frameshift, splice site inframe deletions, and missense variants (Ichhaporia and Hendershot, 2021, PMID: 33557244). Of note, about 40% of individuals with characteristic features of MSS do not have identifiable variants in SIL1 (Krieger et al, 2013, PMID: 24176978). Other causes have not yet been identified.\n\nThirteen variants that have been reported in eleven probands in three publications are included in this curation (Senderek et al, 2005, PMID: 16282977; Anttonen et al, 2005, PMID: 16282978; Krieger et al, 2013, PMID: 24176978). In addition, linkage data is included from Finnish families in which affected individuals are homozygous for a founder variant in the Finnish population (Anttonen et al, 2005, PMID: 16282978). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function.\n\n This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including a spontaneous mouse model known as the woozy mouse (Zhao et al, 2005, PMID: 16116427; Kayashi et al, 2018, PMID: 28723727) and a knock out mouse model (Zhao et al, 2005, PMID: 16116427) both of which recapitulate the cortical atrophy, ataxia, and myopathy observed in human patients, but which typically do not develop cataracts. In addition, cortical neuron migration defects in mice resulting from Sil1 RNAi knockdown were rescued by human SIL1 (Inaguma et al, 2014, PMID: 24473200). In addition, results from analysis of cells and tissues from individuals with MSS and animal models of MSS is reviewed in detail in PMID: 31701543 (Table 2) and PMID: 33557244.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between SIL1 and the autosomal recessive disorder Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
