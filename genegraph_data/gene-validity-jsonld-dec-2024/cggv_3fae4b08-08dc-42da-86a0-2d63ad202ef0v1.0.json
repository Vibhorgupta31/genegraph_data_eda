Deleterious variants in the mtARS genes cause a diverse array of phenotypes, many of which involve the nervous system. Moreover, distinct mutations in mtARSs often cause different clinical manifestations. Recently, the gene encoding mitochondrial tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase (WARS2) was reported to cause 2 different neurological phenotypes, a form of autosomal recessive intellectual disability and a syndrome of severe infantile-onset leukoencephalopathy. Here, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy with compound heterozygous mutations in WARS2 (p.Trp13Gly, p.Ser228Trp) who presented with infantile-onset, Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism at the age of 2 years. Analysis of patient-derived dermal fibroblasts revealed decreased steady-state WARS2 protein and normal OXPHOS content. Muscle mitochondrial studies suggested mitochondrial proliferation without obvious respiratory chain deficiencies at the age of 9 years. This case expands the phenotypic spectrum of WARS2 deficiency and emphasizes the importance of mitochondrial protein synthesis in the pathogenesis of Parkinsonism.","dc:creator":"Burke EA","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Biallelic mutations in mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase cause Levodopa-responsive infantile-onset Parkinsonism."}},{"id":"cggv:a721e21a-cbef-4528-95eb-c9d19fa1c963_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3e5548d4-9875-4bdd-b5fa-49180babb168"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29120065"}],"rdfs:label":"Burke et al 2018"},{"id":"cggv:a721e21a-cbef-4528-95eb-c9d19fa1c963","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a721e21a-cbef-4528-95eb-c9d19fa1c963_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:a721e21a-cbef-4528-95eb-c9d19fa1c963_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Recurrent variant See Musante score 0.5"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Recurrent variant: see Musante localization studies"},{"id":"cggv:619574b2-6daa-4d9c-af5e-26b47c1074fc","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:619574b2-6daa-4d9c-af5e-26b47c1074fc_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:619574b2-6daa-4d9c-af5e-26b47c1074fc_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"Recurrent variant: see Musante\nAlso saw (reduction of WARS2 on WB in fibroblasts but scored in experimental)"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Note: Saw reduction of WARS2 on WB in fibroblasts but scored in experimental (Skorvanek 2022) to avoid over scoring for p.Trp13Gly"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:d956a5ca-5354-45b5-b31c-08946533d0c5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d956a5ca-5354-45b5-b31c-08946533d0c5","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":17,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:3e5548d4-9875-4bdd-b5fa-49180babb168"},{"id":"cggv:9a28eb27-f679-4e06-a639-8d3a90a8899c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015836.4(WARS2):c.325del (p.Ser109fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA526250135"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Whole genome shotgun sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0001324","obo:HP_0002305","obo:HP_0000718","obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0001263"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:21d57ce5-f238-445e-9a13-f17626286318_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3e5548d4-9875-4bdd-b5fa-49180babb168"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28236339","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Intellectual disability (ID) is the hallmark of an extremely heterogeneous group of disorders that comprises a wide variety of syndromic and non-syndromic phenotypes. Here, we report on mutations in two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that are associated with ID in two unrelated Iranian families. In the first family, we identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.514G>A, p.Asp172Asn) in the cytoplasmic seryl-tRNA synthetase (SARS) gene. The mutation affects the enzymatic core domain of the protein and impairs its enzymatic activity, probably leading to reduced cytoplasmic tRNASer concentrations. The mutant protein was predicted to be unstable, which could be substantiated by investigating ectopic mutant SARS in transfected HEK293T cells. In the second family, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene, comprising a nonsense mutation (c.325delA, p.Ser109Alafs*15), which very likely entails nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and a missense mutation (c.37T>G, p.Trp13Gly). The latter affects the mitochondrial localization signal of WARS2, causing protein mislocalization. Including AIMP1, which we have recently implicated in the etiology of ID, three genes with a role in tRNA-aminoacylation are now associated with this condition. We therefore suggest that the functional integrity of tRNAs in general is an important factor in the development and maintenance of human cognitive functions.","dc:creator":"Musante L","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Mutations of the aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases SARS and WARS2 are implicated in the etiology of autosomal recessive intellectual disability."}},{"id":"cggv:cb921a08-f39d-4b36-81f1-40dbde4767d7_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9a28eb27-f679-4e06-a639-8d3a90a8899c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28236339"}],"rdfs:label":"Family 2 Proband Musante V-7"},{"id":"cggv:cb921a08-f39d-4b36-81f1-40dbde4767d7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cb921a08-f39d-4b36-81f1-40dbde4767d7_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:cb921a08-f39d-4b36-81f1-40dbde4767d7_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"***"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"exon 3/6 predicted to undergo NMD"},{"id":"cggv:21d57ce5-f238-445e-9a13-f17626286318","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:21d57ce5-f238-445e-9a13-f17626286318_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:21d57ce5-f238-445e-9a13-f17626286318_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"***"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"0.1 (default) + 0.4 (localization studies in HEK293T cells)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:04b561ec-54b3-4f94-960f-b12a171cefb1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:04b561ec-54b3-4f94-960f-b12a171cefb1","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":2,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:424b0b77-467b-4f4f-9a81-3d3582fd1d09","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015836.4(WARS2):c.797del (p.Pro266fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1035219"}},{"id":"cggv:6d0ef118-a353-43e1-86ad-c4ced6aecc1d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015836.4(WARS2):c.938A>T (p.Lys313Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1035179"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001276","obo:HP_0002352","obo:HP_0001332","obo:HP_0003128","obo:HP_0011097","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001249"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:617f5b26-dfd4-4447-ba92-7c6b4277ebf3_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6d0ef118-a353-43e1-86ad-c4ced6aecc1d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28905505","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondrial protein synthesis involves an intricate interplay between mitochondrial DNA encoded RNAs and nuclear DNA encoded proteins, such as ribosomal proteins and aminoacyl-tRNA synthases.

He was found by whole-exome sequencing to have compound heterozygous variants in WARS2, c.938A>T (p.K313M) and c.298_300delCTT (p.L100del). De novo synthesis of proteins inside mitochondria was reduced in the patient's fibroblasts, leading to significantly lower steady-state levels of respiratory chain subunits compared to control and resulting in lower oxygen consumption rates.","dc:creator":"Theisen BE","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Deficiency of WARS2, encoding mitochondrial tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase, causes severe infantile

However numerous nuclear mutations involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis affecting ubiquitously expressed genes have been reported in association with very tissue specific clinical manifestations suggesting that there are so far unknown factors determining the tissue specificity in mitochondrial translation. Most of these gene defects result in histological abnormalities and multiple respiratory chain defects in the affected organs. The clinical phenotypes are usually early-onset, severe, and often fatal, implying the importance of mitochondrial translation from birth. However, some rare, reversible infantile mitochondrial diseases are caused by very specific defects of mitochondrial translation.

The *WARS2* gene encodes mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase 2, one of the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which function in mitochondrial translation by catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. Defects in tRNA charging can result in impaired synthesis of oxidative phosphorylation complex protein subunits.\n\nThe *WARS2* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2017 (PMID: 28236339). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *WARS2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *WARS2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 10 unique variants, including one nonsense, two frameshift, one in-frame deletion, one exonic deletion, and five missense variants. Of note, c.37T>G (p.Trp13Gly) is a common recurrent variant which is reported at a high allele frequency in gnomAD v3.1.2 (AF 0.003152) and was also reported in six homozygotes in previous versions of gnomAD (v2.1.1). However, this GCEP agreed that, despite the relatively high allele frequency, the mitochondrial localization and consistent reduced WARS2 expression on western blotting from mitochondrial protein extracts in patient fibroblasts were supportive of pathogenicity in the setting of a second more deleterious variant on the other allele, likely indicating this is a hypomorphic allele (PMIDs: 29120065, 32120303, 34890876, 28236339). More than 20 probands from numerous publications have been reported between 2017-2022, and seven probands from six publications were included in this curation (PMIDs: 28236339, 28650581, 29120065, 30920170, 34890876, 31684799). The condition was first described in a 17-year-old Iranian female with childhood onset athetosis, ataxia, muscle weakness, intellectual disability, and aggressive behavior. She had a sibling with similar medical concerns. Subsequent reported cases have demonstrated the spectrum of medical problems seen in those with *WARS2*-related disorders, with features ranging from neonatal lactic acidosis with multi-organ failure, to infantile or childhood onset levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, and/or a variable movement disorder with or without intellectual disability and seizures. Additional features seen in affected individuals include leukoencephalopathy, global brain atrophy, cardiomyopathy, optic atrophy, and retinitis pigmentosa (PMIDs: 28905505, 28650581, 29120065, 34890876, 31684799). Loss-of-function is implicated as a mechanism of disease.  This gene-disease relationship is also supported by its known biochemical function that is shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, patient cell data showing impact on WARS2 expression, as well as Drosophila melanogaster and mouse model data (PMIDs: 30920170, 30566859, 34890876). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 16, 2022 (SOP Version 9).
