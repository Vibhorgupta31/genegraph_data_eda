The abundance of laminin alpha4 chain transcripts in the heart suggests an important role of this protein in cardiovascular development and function. In this study, we demonstrate that laminin alpha4 deficient mice gradually develop cardiac hypertrophy with impaired function. We show that depletion of laminin alpha4 chain did not alter the levels of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) components or affect cell membrane integrity. No alteration in integrin beta 1D protein was observed in terms of expression level or distribution pattern, indicating that the postnatal development of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy in these mice is unlikely associated with the stability of sarcolemmal DGC and integrin complexes. Moreover, cardiomyocytes isolated from Lama4-/- mutant hearts maintained their contractility in vitro. In contrast, elevated levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (Hif1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) transcripts, along with multiple foci of cardiomyocyte degeneration and fibrosis suggested sustained cardiac ischemia. Electron microscopy confirmed malformed blood vessels and wide pericapillary ECM spaces, suggesting the presence of microcirculation abnormalities in Lama4-/- mutant hearts. We thus conclude that mutation in the laminin alpha4 chain leads to abnormal cardiovascular ECM structure that cause insufficient oxygen supply to the heart and the subsequent ischemic cardiac phenotype observed. Our study links the genetic deficiency of an ECM protein to cardiomyopathy and implies a novel pathway of idiopathic cardiomyopathy in human.","dc:creator":"Wang J","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Cardiomyopathy associated with microcirculation dysfunction in laminin alpha4 chain-deficient mice."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse KO model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:e937f98e-7577-48bd-a24a-361634ba0a8d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e937f98e-7577-48bd-a24a-361634ba0a8d_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:38d019dd-991f-42d0-9436-1d399aed9604_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4a4ed4d0-cdd1-4d1e-b9e1-5c9bff4fb30c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"cggv","ageValue":53,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:38d019dd-991f-42d0-9436-1d399aed9604_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:4a48aeaf-7762-4ebb-ad65-a98e6244decd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001105206.3(LAMA4):c.2849C>T (p.Pro950Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/50370"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17646580","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Extracellular matrix proteins, such as laminins, and endothelial cells are known to influence cardiomyocyte performance; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood.","dc:creator":"KnÃ¶ll R","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Laminin-alpha4 and integrin-linked kinase mutations cause human cardiomyopathy via simultaneous defects in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17646580","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"No segregation data"},{"id":"cggv:24521942-b49b-4263-b938-e9bf7fc580d2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5605591b-27eb-4e24-b606-9e6b36fd2355","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"cggv","ageValue":68,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:24521942-b49b-4263-b938-e9bf7fc580d2_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:4a48aeaf-7762-4ebb-ad65-a98e6244decd"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17646580"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17646580","rdfs:label":"Patient 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"No segregation data"},{"id":"cggv:bb37ae91-b9fc-47b8-8652-305adc76e420_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:61f306e2-46b1-4ebb-8c4a-924ae7e3c019","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:bb37ae91-b9fc-47b8-8652-305adc76e420_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:8d5e50d0-c099-46cf-80c6-ddc6b9965749","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000257.4(MYH7):c.2770G>A (p.Glu924Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA013034"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30650640","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Background and objectives: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a rare cardiac disease characterised by left ventricular enlargement, reduced left ventricular contractility, and impaired systolic function. Childhood DCM is clinically and genetically heterogenous and associated with mutations in over 100 genes. The aim of this study was to identify novel variations associated with infantile DCM. Materials and Methods: Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of 181 cardiomyopathy-related genes was performed in three unrelated consanguineous families from Saudi Arabia. Variants were confirmed and their frequency established in 50 known DCM cases and 80 clinically annotated healthy controls. Results: The three index cases presented between 7 and 10 months of age with severe DCM. In Family A, there was digenic inheritance of two heterozygous variants: a novel variant in LAMA4 (c.3925G > A, p.Asp1309Asn) and a known DCM mutation in MYH7 (c.2770G > A; p.Glu924Lys). The LAMA4 p.Asp1309Asn variant was predicted to be likely pathogenic according to international guidelines. The other two families had no identifiable potentially deleterious variants. Conclusions: Inheritance of two genetic variants may have a synergistic or dose effect to cause severe DCM. We report of a novel p.Asp1309Asn variation associated with DCM. Targeted NGS is useful in the molecular diagnosis of DCM and to guide whole-family management and counselling.","dc:creator":"Abdallah AM","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Digenic Inheritance of LAMA4 and MYH7 Mutations in Patient with Infantile Dilated Cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30650640","rdfs:label":"III.1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Proband carrying a P/LP variant on MYH7 cannot speculate the role of LAMA4 VUS."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e937f98e-7577-48bd-a24a-361634ba0a8d_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5edc1909-8eb4-4d58-8be5-b8b4dca49909_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9185d28b-8d48-409b-9800-e44ce6b97ca3","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"cggv","ageValue":29,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:5edc1909-8eb4-4d58-8be5-b8b4dca49909_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:5015757d-8ebc-40ab-a171-42806636818a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001105206.3(LAMA4):c.3238C>T (p.Arg1080Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/50369"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17646580"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17646580","rdfs:label":"Patient 3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"No segregation data"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantNullVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":1183,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":3.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:8deefe2b-8506-4c36-93db-724c7256c34e","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005021","gene":"hgnc:6484","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Sylvius et al. (2001, PMID: 11085912) were the first to identify LAMA4 within the genetic locus linked to DCM. Human genetic evidence supporting the relationship of LAMA4 with autosomal dominant DCM includes case level evidence. Marston et al. (2015, PMID: 26406308) identified a missense variant in LAMA4 classified as VUS in a patient affected by DCM. However, no segregation data were available and it was not scored. In addition, Abdallah and colleagues (2019 PMID: 30650640) described a pediatric case with infantile DCM carrying 2 variants one in LAMA4 (inherited from the father who displayed normal heart evaluation) and one in MYH7 (inherited from the mother who showed mild DCM). As such, there were not enough evidence to conclude that the phenotype is caused by LAMA4 variant but it was more likely caused by the MYH7 variant. Knoll and colleagues (2007, PMID: 17646580) identified 3 variants on LAMA4, including 2 missense variants of unknown significance and the stop codon variant, in 3 DCM patients. Although, immunohistochemistry on myocardial biopsy showed significant loss of endothelial cells carrying the stop codon variant (p.R1073X). In addition, this gene-disease association is supported by animal models. Wang and colleagues (2006, PMID: 16204254) demonstrated that adult LAMA4 -/- mice had increased frequency of sudden death under noninvasive procedures such as induction of anesthesia. At 36â40 weeks of age there was a significant increase in left ventricular end diastolic diameter and an increase in left ventricular end systolic diameter. Gradually, mutant hearts started to display widening of extravascular space, cardiomyocyte degeneration, and fibrosis. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of LAMA4 with autosomal dominant DCM. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on October 11, 2019.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e937f98e-7577-48bd-a24a-361634ba0a8d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
