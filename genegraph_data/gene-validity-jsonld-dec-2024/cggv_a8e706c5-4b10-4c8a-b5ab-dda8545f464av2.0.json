Mutations in either SLC7A9 or SLC3A1 gene result in cystinuria. The mutations of SLC7A9 gene have been identified mainly from Italian, Libyan Jewish, North American, and Spanish patients. In the present study, we have analyzed cystinuria cases from oriental population (mostly Japanese). Mutation analyses of SLC7A9 and SLC3A1 genes were performed on 41 cystinuria patients. The uptake of 14C-labeled cystine in COS-7 cells was measured to determine the functional properties of mutants. The protein expression and localization were examined by Western blot and confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Among 41 patients analyzed, 35 were found to possess mutations in SLC7A9. The most frequent one was a novel missense mutation P482L that affects a residue near the C-terminus end of the protein and causes severe loss of function. In MDCK II and HEK293 cells, we found that P482L protein was expressed and sorted to the plasma membrane as well as wild type. The alteration of Pro482 with amino acids with bulky side chains reduced the transport function of b(0,+)AT/BAT1. Interestingly, the mutations of SLC7A9 for Japanese cystinuria patients are different from those reported for European and American population.

The cohort comprised 272 genetically unresolved individuals (106 children and 166 adults) from 268 families with nephrolithiasis (n=256) or isolated nephrocalcinosis (n=16). We detected 50 likely causative mutations in 14 of 30 analyzed genes, leading to a molecular diagnosis in 14.9% (40 of 268) of all cases; 20 of 50 detected mutations were novel (40%). The cystinuria gene SLC7A9 (n=19) was most frequently mutated. The percentage of monogenic cases was notably high in both the adult (11.4%) and pediatric cohorts (20.8%). Recessive causes were more frequent among children, whereas dominant disease occurred more abundantly in adults. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of monogenic causes of kidney stone disease.

Mutations in SLC3A1, which encodes rBAT, cause Type I cystinuria, and mutations in SLC7A9, which encodes a putative subunit of rBAT (b(o,+)AT), cause non-Type I cystinuria. Here we describe the genomic structure of SLC7A9 (13 exons) and 28 new mutations in this gene that, together with the seven previously reported, explain 79% of the alleles in 61 non-Type I cystinuria patients.

Among heterozygotes carrying these mutations, A182T heterozygotes showed the lowest urinary excretion values of cystine and dibasic amino acids. Functional analysis of mutation A182T after co-expression with rBAT in HeLa cells revealed significant residual transport activity. In contrast, mutations G105R, V170M and R333W are associated to a complete or almost complete loss of transport activity, leading to a more severe urinary phenotype in heterozygotes. SLC7A9 mutations located in the putative transmembrane domains of b(o,+)AT and affecting conserved amino acid residues with a small side chain generate a severe phenotype, while mutations in non-conserved residues give rise to a mild phenotype.

Trafficking of the transporter requires the intracellular assembly of the two subunits. Without its partner, rBAT, but not b(0,+)AT, is rapidly degraded. We analyzed the initial biogenesis of wild-type rBAT and type I cystinuria rBAT mutants. rBAT was degraded, at least in part, via the ERAD pathway. Assembly with b(0,+)AT within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) blocked rBAT degradation and could be independent of the calnexin chaperone system. This system was, however, necessary for post-assembly maturation of the heterodimer. Without b(0,+)AT, wild-type and rBAT mutants were degraded with similar kinetics. In its presence, rBAT mutants showed strongly reduced (L89P) or no transport activity, failed to acquire complex N-glycosylation and to oligomerize, suggesting assembly and/or folding defects. Most of the transmembrane domain mutant L89P did not heterodimerize with b(0,+)AT and was degraded. However, the few [L89P]rBAT-b(0,+)AT heterodimers were stable, consistent with assembly, but not folding, defects. Mutants of the rBAT extracellular domain (T216M, R365W, M467K and M467T) efficiently assembled with b(0,+)AT but were subsequently degraded. Together with earlier results, the data suggest a two-step biogenesis model, with the early assembly of the subunits followed by folding of the rBAT extracellular domain.

Cystinuria is caused by defects in the amino acid transport system b0,+ (i.e. the rBAT/b0,+AT heteromeric complex). Mutations in SLC3A1, encoding rBAT, cause cystinuria type A, characterized by a silent phenotype in heterozygotes (phenotype I). Mutations in SLC7A9, encoding b0,+AT, cause cystinuria type B, in which heterozygotes in most cases hyperexcrete cystine and dibasic amino acids (phenotype non-I). To facilitate in vivo investigation of b0,+AT in cystinuria, Slc7a9 knockout mice have been generated. Expression of b0,+AT protein is completely abolished in the kidney of Slc7a9-/- mice ('Stones'). In contrast, Stones expressed significant amounts of rBAT protein, which is covalently linked to unidentified light subunit(s). Stones mice present a dramatic hyperexcretion of cystine and dibasic amino acids, while Slc7a9+/- mice show moderate but significant hyperexcretion of these amino acids (phenotype non-I). Forty-two per cent of Stones mice develop cystine calculi in the urinary system. Calculi develop during the first month of life and grow throughout the life span of the animals. Histopathology in kidney reveals typical changes for urolithiasis (tubular and pelvic dilatation, tubular necrosis, tubular hyaline droplets and chronic interstitial nephritis). The fact that some Stones mice, generated in a mixed genetic background, develop cystine calculi from an early age, while others do not develop them in their first year of life, suggests the involvement of modifier genes in the lithiasis phenotype.

At least 153 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, complex rearrangement, etc.) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 23532419, 16609684, 25296721, 11157794, 10471498). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in two additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of SLC7A9 in a cystine, ornithine, arginine, and lysine transporter protein complex (PMID: 12234930), its interaction with rBAT in that complex (PMID: 18332091), and its expression in the kidneys (PMID: 25613900), where the protein complex absorbs cystine, ornithine, arginine, and lysine back into the blood during urine formation. This gene-disease relationship is further supported by a knockout mouse model which recapitulates the elevated cystine, ornithine, arginine, and lysine levels associated with abnormal function of this protein, leading to formation of cystine crystals and stones in the bladder or kidneys (PMID: 12915471). In mice, as in humans, the heterozygous individuals have an intermediate level of urinary cystine; elevated above normal but lower than the homozygotes (Reviewd in PMID: 30515543). In humans the cystinuria in heterozygotes has, on occassion, been associated with kidney stones however modifying genes or environmental factors may contribute to the phenotype (PMID: 25383320). In summary, SLC7A9 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive cystinuria. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a8e706c5-4b10-4c8a-b5ab-dda8545f464a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
