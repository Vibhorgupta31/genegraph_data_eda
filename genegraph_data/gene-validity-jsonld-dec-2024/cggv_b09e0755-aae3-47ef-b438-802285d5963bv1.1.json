Here, we report detection and validation of the underlying cause of progressive retinal degeneration in a nuclear family of European descent with a single affected individual. Whole genome sequencing of the proband and her unaffected sibling identified a novel intron 8 donor splice site variant (c.1296 + 1G>A) and a novel 731 base pair deletion encompassing exon 9 (Chr2:g.112751488_112752218 del) resulting in c.1297_1451del; p.K433_G484fsTer3 in the Mer tyrosine kinase protooncogene (MERTK), which is highly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The proband carried both variants in the heterozygous state, which segregated with disease in the pedigree. These MERTK variants are predicted to result in the defective splicing of exon 8 and loss of exon 9 respectively. To evaluate the impact of these novel variants, peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the proband and her parents were reprogrammed to humaninduced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines, which were subsequently differentiated to hiPSC-RPE. Analysis of the proband's hiPSC-RPE revealed the absence of both MERTK transcript and its respective protein as well as abnormal phagocytosis when compared with the parental hiPSC-RPE. In summary, whole genome sequencing identified novel compound heterozygous variants in MERTK as the underlying cause of progressive retinal degeneration in a simplex case. Further, analysis using an hiPSC-RPE model established the functional impact of novel MERTK mutations and revealed the potential mechanism underlying pathology in the proband.","dc:creator":"Biswas P","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Detection and validation of novel mutations in MERTK in a simplex case of retinal degeneration using WGS and hiPSC-RPEs model."}},"rdfs:label":"II:II"},{"id":"cggv:eb2ce3ea-c54a-4f1a-be37-8bbeb6b3ea17","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eb2ce3ea-c54a-4f1a-be37-8bbeb6b3ea17_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:eb2ce3ea-c54a-4f1a-be37-8bbeb6b3ea17_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"To evaluate the impact of these novel variants, per- ipheral blood mononuclear cells of the proband and her parents were repro- grammed to humaninduced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines, which were subsequently differentiated to hiPSC–RPE.

Thus we have created a faithful cellular model of arRP incorporating the human genetic background which will allow us to investigate in detail the disease mechanism, explore screening of a variety of therapeutic compounds/reagents and design either combined cell and gene- based therapies or independent approaches.

Given the RPE cell- autonomous nature of the RCS phagocytosis defect and the importance of outer segment renewal to the well being of the photoreceptor cell, it is possible that MERTK, or a molecule with which it interacts, is involved in the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10699188","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Vertebrate photoreceptor cells are the basic sensory apparatus of the retina, capable of converting the energy of absorbed photons into neuronal signals. The proximal portions of mammalian photoreceptor outer segments are synthesized daily by cell bodies, and outer segment tips are shed with a circadian rhythm, resulting in a complete turnover of outer segments about every 9 days. The shed outer segments are phagocytosed by adjacent retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, and metabolites are recycled to photoreceptors. The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat is a widely studied, classic model of recessively inherited retinal degeneration in which the RPE fails to phagocytose shed outer segments, and photoreceptor cells subsequently die. We have used a positional cloning approach to study the rdy (retinal dystrophy) locus of the RCS rat. Within a 0.3 cM genetic inclusion interval, we have discovered a small deletion of RCS DNA that disrupts the gene encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase Mertk. The deletion includes the splice acceptor site upstream of the second coding exon of Mertk and results in a shortened transcript that lacks this exon. The aberrant transcript joins the first and third coding exons, leading to a frameshift and a translation termination signal 20 codons after the AUG. The concordance of these and other data indicate that Mertk is probably the gene for rdy. Our results provide genetic evidence for an essential role of a receptor tyrosine kinase in a specialized form of phagocytosis and suggest a molecular model for ingestion of outer segments by RPE cells.","dc:creator":"D'Cruz PM","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Mutation of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene Mertk in the retinal dystrophic RCS rat."},"rdfs:label":"RCS rat"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:fd4516ec-0e05-41b7-9cdc-9bfb9c704ed8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fc6a9ee1-d62d-4ae4-b7e3-c2843f5d88ee","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Ablation of Mer function in merkd mice results in a retinal phenotype almost identical with that of RCS rats.

The disease entity has previously been described as retinitis pigmentosa 38. To encompass a range of phenotypes and to account for the genetic heterogeneity in inherited retinopathy, the disease entity used for this curation is MERTK-related retinopathy (MONDO:0800394).\n\n*MERTK* (MER proto-oncogene, tyrosine kinase) (MIM*604705) is localized to chromosome 2q14.1 and consists of 19 exons (Weier, Fung, & Lersch, 1999). It encodes the tyrosine-protein kinase Mer, a 999-amino-acid transmembrane protein (Uniprot#Q12866) belonging to the TAM (TYRO3/AXL/MER) receptor kinase family. MERTK is highly expressed in monocyte/macrophages, and in epithelial cells including the Retina Pigment Epithelium (RPE). It plays a critical role in the shedding of photoreceptor outer segments prior to phagocytosis, a circadian process essential for photoreceptor homeostasis (Feng et al., 2002). \n\n*MERTK* was first associated with retinopathy after the identification of a deletion in the gene causing the naturally occurring autosomal recessive (AR) retinal degeneration of the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat (D'Cruz et al., 2000), a retinal dystrophy model secondary to a phagocytic defect of the RPE.\n\nBiallelic variants in *MERTK* underlying retinopathy in humans were first reported by Gal et al. (2000). The associated retinopathy phenotype is usually severe, characterized by an early onset of the disease, with night blindness and progressive visual field constriction due to loss of rod photoreceptors, and rapid macular involvement.\n\nA total of 79 variants have already been identified underlying rod-cone dystrophy. The variant spectrum in *MERTK* includes 33 missense, 12 nonsense, 12 splice defects, 12 small deletions, 2 small insertion–deletions, 3 small duplications, and 2 exonic and 3 gross deletions (PMID: 29659094). Altogether, variants in *MERTK* account for ∼2% of retinopathy cases with a severe phenotype. No specific phenotype/genotype correlations have been reported, most likely due to the diversity of the variant spectrum in a yet limited number of patients.\n\nIn this curation, data from 3 consanguineous families with multiple patients and 3 isolated individuals with 8 unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, missense), were collected from 6 publications (Ksantini M, et al., 2012, PMID: 22180149, Bhatia S, et al., 2019, PMID: 30851773, McHenry CL, et al., 2004, PMID: 15111602, Lukovic D, et al., 2015, PMID: 26263531, Mackay DS, et al., 2010, PMID: 20300561, Biswas P, et al., 2021, PMID: 33252167). More data is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by functional studies and model systems, described above (D'Cruz PM, et al., 2000, PMID: 10699188, Lukovic D, et al., 2015, PMID: 26263531, McHenry CL, et al., 2004, PMID: 15111602, Duncan JL, et al., 2003, PMID: 12556419). Results described by D'Cruz PM, et al., 2000, PMID: 10699188, provide genetic evidence for an essential role of a receptor tyrosine kinase in a specialized form of phagocytosis and suggest a molecular model for ingestion of outer segments by RPE cells.\n\nIn summary, *ΜΕRΤΚ* is definitively associated with the autosomal recessive inherited retinal dystrophy, MERTK-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 7, 2022.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b09e0755-aae3-47ef-b438-802285d5963b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
