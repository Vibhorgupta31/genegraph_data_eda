In the latter two, the neuropathy is thought to result from the accumulation of specific fatty acids. We describe here three patients with elevated plasma concentrations of pristanic acid (a branched-chain fatty acid) and C27-bile-acid intermediates. Two of the patients suffered from adult-onset sensory motor neuropathy. One patient also had pigmentary retinopathy, suggesting Refsum disease, whereas the other patient had upper motor neuron signs in the legs, suggesting adrenomyeloneuropathy. The third patient was a child without neuropathy. In all three patients we discovered a deficiency of alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR). This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of pristanoyl-CoA and C27-bile acyl-CoAs to their (S)-stereoisomers, which are the only stereoisomers that can be degraded via peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Sequence analysis of AMACR cDNA from the patients identified two different mutations that are likely to cause disease, based on analysis in Escherichia coli. Our findings have implications for the diagnosis of adult-onset neuropathies of unknown aetiology.","dc:creator":"Ferdinandusse S","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Mutations in the gene encoding peroxisomal alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase cause adult-onset sensory motor neuropathy."}},"rdfs:label":"Ferdinandusse_Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:e9bb11db-07f8-4d61-9f49-05ca6638b497","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9bb11db-07f8-4d61-9f49-05ca6638b497_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e9bb11db-07f8-4d61-9f49-05ca6638b497_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Expression of the variant and wild-type AMACR protein as fusions to maltose-binding protein in E. coli lysates showed that the variant resulted in inactive protein."}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The proband was homozygous for the Ser52Pro variant.

The disorder is recessively inherited and caused by mutations in the AMACR gene, which encodes Amacr, an enzyme presumed to be essential for bile acid synthesis and to participate in the degradation of methyl-branched fatty acids. To generate a model to study the pathophysiology in Amacr deficiency we inactivated the mouse Amacr gene. As per human Amacr deficiency, the Amacr(-/-) mice showed accumulation (44-fold) of C27 bile acid precursors and decreased (over 50%) primary (C24) bile acids in bile, serum and liver, however the Amacr(-/-) mice were clinically symptomless. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that, among other responses, the level of mRNA for peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme type 1 (pMFE-1) was increased 3-fold in Amacr(-/-) mice. This enzyme can be placed, together with CYP3A11 and CYP46A1, to make an Amacr-independent pathway for the generation of C24 bile acids. Exposure of Amacr(-/-) mice to a diet supplemented with phytol, a source for branched-chain fatty acids, triggered the development of a disease state with liver manifestations, redefining the physiological significance of Amacr. Amacr is indispensable for the detoxification of dietary methyl-branched lipids and, although it contributes normally to bile acid synthesis from cholesterol, the putative pMFE-1-mediated cholesterol degradation can provide for generation of bile acids, allowing survival without Amacr. Based upon our mouse model, we propose elimination of phytol from the diet of patients suffering from Amacr deficiency.","dc:creator":"Savolainen K","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"A mouse model for alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase deficiency: adjustment of bile acid synthesis and intolerance to dietary methyl-branched lipids."},"rdfs:label":"Savolainen_Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The model is scored slightly reduced points for absence of clinical phenotype."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":5725,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":9.1,"subject":{"id":"cggv:3df3590a-b147-4a96-8882-4766fce31330","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013681","gene":"hgnc:451","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"2.2","dc:description":"The relationship between *AMACR* and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency (congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 4 included), an autosomal recessive disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of September, 2019 and updated as of March 2022. AMACR encodes an enzyme that interconverts pristanoyl-CoA and C27-bile acylCoAs between their (R)- and (S)-stereoisomers. The conversion to the (S)-stereoisomers is necessary for degradation of these substrates by peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Patients with *AMACR* variants present typically with neuropathy and retinitis pigmentosa, with elevated pristanic acid levels. *AMACR* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive AMACR deficiency in 2000 (Ferdinandusse et al, PMID: 10655068).\n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (8.1 points):\nAt least 8 patients across 7 publications have been reported with the same homozygous missense variant, Ser52Pro (PMIDs: 10655068, 12512044, 21686617, 21576695, 20821052, 15249642, 33047465). A few other missense variants have also been reported (PMID: 10655068, 20921516, 23286897, 34267495). A deletion encompassing 5 genes including AMACR is reported in a patient with oculocutaneous albinism and AMACR deficiency (PMID: 22987308). This evidence cannot be scored in the GCI, but warrants a score of 1 point. The mechanism is expected to be homozygous loss of function. \n  \nSummary of experimental data (2 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by a mouse model that recapitulates the human biochemical phenotype (PMID 25168382). The enzyme is highly expressed in peroxisomes, followed by mitochondria (PMID: 7649182). \n  \nIn summary, this gene-disease relationship of *AMACR* and AMACR deficiency is classified as Moderate. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3fb8a3ea-cf06-4788-841f-e787f3780a49"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
