In its aa sequence (837 and 881 aa, calculated pIs: 9.33 and 9.38, mol wts 92,750 and 97,410 kD), it is conspicuously related to the 80-kD plakophilin 1, with which it shares a central region of 9 repeats of the arm-motif, preceeded by a long head region and followed by a very short (11 aa) carboxy-terminal sequence. Plakophilin 2 and its mRNA have been detected in a wide range of tissues and cell types, including cells devoid of desmosomes. By light and electron microscopical immunolocalization, plakophilin 2 has been localized to plaques of desmosomes of one-layered (\"simple\") and complex epithelia, carcinomas, diverse epithelium-derived cell culture lines, as well as cardiac tissue and the dendritic reticulum cells of lymphatic germinal centers, i.e., desmosomes in which plakophilin 1 is not detected. However, plakophilin 2 has also been localized in the desmosomes of certain but not all stratified epithelia where it coexists with plakophilin 1. Remarkably, plakophilin 2 is also enriched in the karyoplasm of a wide range of cell types, including many that lack desmosomes and in which, therefore, the nuclear state is the only locally enriched form of plakophilin 2 present. We conclude that plakophilins 2a and 2b are basic nuclear proteins that in certain cell types additionally assemble with other proteins to form the desmosomal plaque and serve general nuclear functions as well as a function specific to many but not all desmosomes.","dc:creator":"Mertens C","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Plakophilins 2a and 2b: constitutive proteins of dual location in the karyoplasm and the desmosomal plaque."},"rdfs:label":"PKP2 expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1231ec3b-3570-48dd-bea4-f7cd7fc54811_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6006f52c-3df6-4cd2-b747-b779a75c8849","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d23f634b-a125-4391-89ef-bf46c4db55d5","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Cardiomyocite-specific, tamoxifen-activated PKP2 KO mice: isoprotenerol treatment induced polymorphic ventricular ectopy, couplet, triplets and runs of polymorphic NSVT along, at a structurally-normal heart stage (resembling CPVT).

Variants in PKP2 (in particular truncating loss of function variants) are associated with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM/ARVC) and it has been classified as a Definitive gene by the ARVC Gene Curation Expert Panel. The evidence for a role of PKP2 variants in CPVT comes from a single study in which PKP2 was sequenced in a cohort of 18 patients that had been diagnosed with CPVT and were negative for variants in established CPVT genes (in addition to 19 sudden cardiac death cases with structurally normal hearts) (Tester et al, 2019, PMID:30678776). Although truncating variants in PKP2 were detected in 6 cases, the expert panel (and indeed the authors of the paper) believed that these patients were likely to have concealed ARVC and had been diagnosed with CPVT due to exercise-associated arrhythmias prior to structural heart changes. Indeed one of these cases was subsequently diagnosed with ARVC and right ventricular structural changes were subsequently observed in two others. A cardiomyocyte-specific PKP2 mouse knockout model displayed similar phenotypes, with isoproterenol triggered polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias mimicking CPVT observed prior to structural changes (Cerrone et al, 2017, PMID:28740174). In conclusion, we believe that PKP2 variants are not associated with CPVT and therefore the expert panel decided to classify PKP2 as disputed for CPVT. However, as a CPVT-like phenotype can be observed in ARVC patients with truncating PKP2 variants (during the concealed cardiomyopathy phase of the disease), it may be beneficial to include this gene in extended arrhythmia genetic testing panels for patients with a CPVT-like phenotype if no causative variants are found when sequencing validated CPVT genes. If truncating variants in PKP2 are detected in such cases, it would suggest a diagnosis of ARVC. Note: All CPVT genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams was reviewed by the CPVT Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP). The classification and summary presented here is the conclusion of this GCEP's analysis according to evidence teams' efforts. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia Gene Curation Expert Panel on 20th January, 2021 (SOP Version 7).\nAlthough PKP2 truncating variants were detected in patients that had been diagnosed with CPVT, the expert panel deemed that these were likely to be ARVC cases in the concealed cardiomyopathy stage and therefore this association was classified as disputed.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1231ec3b-3570-48dd-bea4-f7cd7fc54811"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
