In this study, we have analysed a previously uncharacterised gene encoding a 180-amino acid protein, hereby named 'coiled-coil protein 1 (ccp1)', that showed a modest up-regulation upon FGF2 stimulation. Northern blots and RT-PCR showed specific expression of ccp1 in multiple tissues including adult and embryonic brains. In situ hybridizations revealed that ccp1 was expressed in the cortical plate between Reelin and Tbr1-positive layers in the dorsal cortex at E15.5. Furthermore, the expression pattern of ccp1 at E13.5-E14.5 reflected some of the aspects of tangential migration of cortical progenitors during the early phase. We observed that the expressed ccp1 protein was localised to endo/lysosomal compartment in the cell body as well as to vesicles present in the processes of primary cortical neurons and oligodendrocyte cell line.","dc:creator":"Pellicano F","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Expression of coiled-coil protein 1, a novel gene downstream of FGF2, in the developing brain."},"rdfs:label":"Liver Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a15c4c38-77c7-4bad-95f8-b2d2a163d05a_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2ed4406f-95cc-4d3c-a382-3fe08be285b7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:078fe341-47c1-4707-9481-a5e8f445cc99","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The authors used metabolic labeling of sialic acids with alkynyl-tagged sialic acid precursor ManNA1, which is incorporated into nascent glycoproteins and detected with fluorescently labeled azides.

The highly heterogeneous clinical spectrum is not explained by our current understanding of the underlying cell-biological processes in the Golgi. Therefore, uncovering genetic defects and annotating gene function are challenging. Exome sequencing in a family with three siblings affected by abnormal Golgi glycosylation revealed a homozygous missense mutation, c.92T>C (p.Leu31Ser), in coiled-coil domain containing 115 (CCDC115), the function of which is unknown. The same mutation was identified in three unrelated families, and in one family it was compound heterozygous in combination with a heterozygous deletion of CCDC115. An additional homozygous missense mutation, c.31G>T (p.Asp11Tyr), was found in a family with two affected siblings. All individuals displayed a storage-disease-like phenotype involving hepatosplenomegaly, which regressed with age, highly elevated bone-derived alkaline phosphatase, elevated aminotransferases, and elevated cholesterol, in combination with abnormal copper metabolism and neurological symptoms. Two individuals died of liver failure, and one individual was successfully treated by liver transplantation. Abnormal N- and mucin type O-glycosylation was found on serum proteins, and reduced metabolic labeling of sialic acids was found in fibroblasts, which was restored after complementation with wild-type CCDC115. PSI-BLAST homology detection revealed reciprocal homology with Vma22p, the yeast V-ATPase assembly factor located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Human CCDC115 mainly localized to the ERGIC and to COPI vesicles, but not to the ER. These data, in combination with the phenotypic spectrum, which is distinct from that associated with defects in V-ATPase core subunits, suggest a more general role for CCDC115 in Golgi trafficking. Our study reveals CCDC115 deficiency as a disorder of Golgi homeostasis that can be readily identified via screening for abnormal glycosylation in plasma.

Subjects with only one mutation may show clinical signs and individuals with biallelic changes may remain asymptomatic. We aimed to achieve a conclusive genetic diagnosis for 34 patients clinically diagnosed of WD. Genetic analysis comprised from analysis of exons to WES (whole exome sequencing), including promoter, introns, UTRs (untranslated regions), besides of study of large deletions/duplications by MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification). Biallelic ATP7B mutations were identified in 30 patients, so that four patients were analyzed using WES. Two affected siblings resulted to be compound heterozygous for mutations in CCDC115, which is involved in a form of congenital disorder of glycosylation. In sum, the majority of patients with a WD phenotype carry ATP7B mutations. However, if genetic diagnosis is not achieved, additional genes should be considered because other disorders may mimic WD.","dc:creator":"Sánchez-Monteagudo A","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Genetics of Wilson disease and Wilson-like phenotype in a clinical series from eastern Spain."}},{"id":"cggv:d481303c-4ad9-417d-962f-c54556d3e18d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f2419a48-607d-4874-b5e3-5586949e6e29"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32043565"}],"rdfs:label":"EW110"},{"id":"cggv:b4d6f868-2df0-4b96-a3d4-065fb801718a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b4d6f868-2df0-4b96-a3d4-065fb801718a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:d481303c-4ad9-417d-962f-c54556d3e18d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d481303c-4ad9-417d-962f-c54556d3e18d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:99fe5e3f-6878-4196-822d-02ab7bfdb824_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:99fe5e3f-6878-4196-822d-02ab7bfdb824","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":16,"allele":{"id":"cggv:0f3e842a-6653-43c4-b93e-5c45c4d15818"},"detectionMethod":"Exome sequenced in patient, direct sequenced CCDC115 and TMEM199 in parents.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Hepatosplenomegaly and choleostasis reported at birth.

Seven variants (missense, nonsense, large deletion) that have been reported in 10 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs 26833332, 29759592, 32043565, 33413482) are included in this curation. Patients have a range of symptoms, including hepatosplenomegaly, elevated aminotransferases, and elevated cholesterol, in combination with abnormal copper metabolism and neurological symptoms. The disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are reportedly unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by the in vitro assays showing a deficiency in Golgi glycosylation and hyperlipidemia (PMIDs 26833332, 34626841) as well as expression in relevant tissues (PMID 16378758). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.
