In addition, we compared a combined, intracerebral ventricles and systemic, administration of an rAAV9 vector encoding SUMF1 gene to the single administrations-either directly in brain, or systemic alone -in MSD mice. The combined treatment resulted in the global activation of sulfatases, near-complete clearance of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and decrease of inflammation in both the central nervous system (CNS) and visceral organs.

The clinical course ranges from neonatal severe to mild juvenile cases. MSD is caused by mutations in the SUMF1 gene encoding the formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE). FGE posttranslationally activates sulfatases by generating formylglycine in their catalytic sites. We analyzed the functional consequences of missense mutations p.A177P, p.W179S, p.A279V and p.R349W with regard to FGE's subcellular localization, enzymatic activity, protein stability, intracellular retention and resulting sulfatase activities. All four mutations did not affect localization of FGE in the endoplasmic reticulum of MSD fibroblasts. However, they decreased its specific enzymatic activity to less than 1% (p.A177P and p.R349W), 3% (p.W179S) or 23% (p.A279V). Protein stability was severely decreased for p.A279V and p.R349W, and almost comparable to wild type for p.A177P and p.W179S. The patient with the mildest clinical phenotype carries the mutation p.A279V leading to decreased FGE protein stability, but high residual enzymatic activity and only slightly reduced sulfatase activities. In contrast, the most severely affected patient carries the mutation p.R349W leading to drastically decreased protein stability, very low residual enzymatic activity and considerably reduced sulfatase activities. Our functional studies provide novel insight into the molecular defect underlying MSD and reveal that both residual enzyme activity and protein stability of FGE contribute to the clinical phenotype. The application of improved functional assays to determine these two molecular parameters of FGE mutants may enable the prediction of the clinical outcome in the future.","dc:creator":"Schlotawa L","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Molecular analysis of SUMF1 mutations: stability and residual activity of mutant formylglycine-generating enzyme determine disease severity in multiple sulfatase deficiency."}},{"id":"cggv:1c36d967-4c71-4b16-923e-729341b121c7_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:53d67bb6-3fac-40c4-b959-218d751b9d59"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18157819"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 4 - Schlotawa"},{"id":"cggv:b4816c87-18a9-4324-9ea1-863d5109ef4f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b4816c87-18a9-4324-9ea1-863d5109ef4f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b4816c87-18a9-4324-9ea1-863d5109ef4f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"shown to result in <1% wild-type enzyme activity (PMID: 18157819)"}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1c36d967-4c71-4b16-923e-729341b121c7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1c36d967-4c71-4b16-923e-729341b121c7_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ee8858e8-2d6e-4e38-8b89-c6752b07aa19_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ee8858e8-2d6e-4e38-8b89-c6752b07aa19","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:46d318fe-1541-4d49-bd6d-2958e290e71d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_182760.4(SUMF1):c.979C>T (p.Arg327Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA115669"}},{"id":"cggv:f40bac11-c88a-4f37-98dc-74ab5ef401ab","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_182760.4(SUMF1):c.519+5_519+8del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA212799"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:5a582547-c17f-4243-ad1d-fd38b2c8abb9_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f40bac11-c88a-4f37-98dc-74ab5ef401ab"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12757705"},{"id":"cggv:d8126b36-a660-466b-87e7-85267a586a73_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:46d318fe-1541-4d49-bd6d-2958e290e71d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12757705"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 2"},{"id":"cggv:5a582547-c17f-4243-ad1d-fd38b2c8abb9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5a582547-c17f-4243-ad1d-fd38b2c8abb9_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:5a582547-c17f-4243-ad1d-fd38b2c8abb9_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 12757705: in MSD patient fibroblasts, transfection of SUMF1 cDNA with the c.519+5_519+8del variant did not restore sulfatase activities, whereas rescue was seen when the fibroblasts were transfected with wild-type SUMF1 cDNA"}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:d8126b36-a660-466b-87e7-85267a586a73","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d8126b36-a660-466b-87e7-85267a586a73_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d8126b36-a660-466b-87e7-85267a586a73_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 18157819: Functional data - resulted in undetectable SUMF1 enzyme activity (measured using a synthetic peptide derived from arylsulfatase A as substrate) and undetectable expression of SUMF1 protein in patient fibroblasts (assessed by Western blot)"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5091,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:25728562-fdc1-4420-a7bd-57d551b5d58f","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010088","gene":"hgnc:20376","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between the SUMF1 gene and multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD), an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of July 31, 2022. SUMF1 encodes sulfatase-modifying factor 1, an enzyme that activates sulfatases via oxidizing cysteine to C-alpha-formylglycine, an aldehyde which is essential for sulfatase catalytic function (PMID: 12757706). Individuals with multiple sulfatase deficiency show impaired SUMF1-mediated activation of multiple sulfatase enzymes, resulting in accumulation of sulfate-containing substrates in multiple tissues, leading to characteristic disease manifestations including neurologic impairment, organomegaly, and ichthyosis (PMID: 32621519). \n\nThe disease mechanism of MSD is loss of function. MSD was first reported in 1961 by Mossakowski et al. (PMID: 14476546) and the first reports of biallelic variants in SUMF1 among MSD cases were in 2003 by Dierks et al. (PMID: 12757705) and Cosma et al. (PMID: 12757706). Both case-level (genetic) and experimental evidence support the relationship between SUMF1 and MSD. Reported causal variants include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-altering variants (PMID: 12757706, PMID: 18157819, PMID: 12757705, PMID: 25885655). In total, ten variants from five probands in four publications were curated. Although there is additional published case-level evidence available, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence for the relationship between SUMF1 and MSD includes: the biochemical function of the gene product (sulfatase-modifying factor 1) being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified individuals with MSD (PMID: 12757706, PMID: 32621519); the biochemical and clinical features of SUMF1 knockout mice (PMID: 17360554); and rescue of enzyme function via gene therapy in SUMF1 knockout mice (PMID: 21326216). Additional experimental evidence is available, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has already been reached.\n\nIn sum, SUMF1 is definitively associated with MSD. The association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical and research settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on September 6, 2022 (SOP v9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2d64d13d-c2dc-4749-8330-fade259ca381"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
