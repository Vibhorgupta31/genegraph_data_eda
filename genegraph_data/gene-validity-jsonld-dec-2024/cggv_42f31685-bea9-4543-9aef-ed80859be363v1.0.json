Synthetases help to ensure accurate translation of the genetic code by using both highly accurate cognate substrate recognition and stringent proofreading of noncognate products. While alterations in the quality control mechanisms of synthetases are generally detrimental to cellular viability, recent studies suggest that in some instances such changes facilitate adaption to stress conditions. Beyond their central role in translation, synthetases are also emerging as key players in an increasing number of other cellular processes, with far-reaching consequences in health and disease. The biochemical versatility of the synthetases has also proven pivotal in efforts to expand the genetic code, further emphasizing the wide-ranging roles of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family in synthetic and natural biology.","dc:creator":"Rubio Gomez MA","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases."},"rdfs:label":"NARS1 Biochemical Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:42f31685-bea9-4543-9aef-ed80859be363_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:603dcc88-a9ec-4f3c-ba2d-3fee37f85d31","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fa1bb129-d633-4b08-9f05-b6d4bd7db127","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"In comparison with controls, AsnRS1 enzymatic activity was reduced in proband-derived fibroblasts and lymphoblasts.

We demonstrate a reduction in NARS1 mRNA expression as well as in NARS1 enzyme levels and activity in both individual fibroblasts and induced neural progenitor cells (iNPCs). Molecular modeling of the recessive c.1633C>T (p.Arg545Cys) variant shows weaker spatial positioning and tRNA selectivity.

NEDMILEG is characterized by global developmental delay, delayed walking with variable gait abnormalities, impaired intellectual development with poor or absent speech and language, and progressive microcephaly. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance patterns during the precuration. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, autosomal dominant (AD) neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, impaired language, epilepsy, and gait abnormalities (NEDMILEG) (OMIM:619092) and autosomal recessive (AR) neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, impaired language, and gait abnormalities (OMIM:619091). The split curation for AR NEDMILG has been curated separately with evidence for  AD NEDMILG included here. Two missense and one nonsense variants that have been reported in eight probands in one publication (PMID: 32738225) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown at this time. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional alteration of patient cells, a zebrafish model, and biochemical function (PMIDs: 32738225, 32303649). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date March 6th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:42f31685-bea9-4543-9aef-ed80859be363"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
