After incubation with 1 mM glucose, these four cell strains exhibited lactate/pyruvate ratios that were six times greater than those of controls. On further analysis, enzymatic activities of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, NADH cytochrome c reductase, succinate dehydrogenase, and succinate cytochrome c reductase were severely deficient. In two of the siblings the enzymatic activity of cytochrome oxidase was mildly decreased (by approximately 50%). Metabolite analysis performed on urine samples taken from these patients revealed high levels of glycine, leucine, valine, and isoleucine, indicating abnormalities of both the glycine-cleavage system and branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase. In contrast, the activities of fibroblast pyruvate carboxylase, mitochondrial aconitase, and citrate synthase were normal. Immunoblot analysis of selected complex III subunits (core 1, cyt c(1), and iron-sulfur protein) and of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex subunits revealed no visible changes in the levels of all examined proteins, decreasing the possibility that an import and/or assembly factor is involved. To elucidate the underlying molecular defect, analysis of microcell-mediated chromosome-fusion was performed between the present study's fibroblasts (recipients) and a panel of A9 mouse:human hybrids (donors) developed by Cuthbert et al. (1995). Complementation was observed between the recipient cells from both families and the mouse:human hybrid clone carrying human chromosome 2. These results indicate that the underlying defect in our patients is under the control of a nuclear gene, the locus of which is on chromosome 2. A 5-cM interval has been identified as potentially containing the critical region for the unknown gene. This interval maps to region 2p14-2p13.","dc:creator":"Seyda A","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"A novel syndrome affecting multiple mitochondrial functions, located by microcell-mediated transfer to chromosome 2p14-2p13."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1adb01f7-d226-4f55-ab00-adb513c20e80_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2c16e1b2-70e5-4bc6-8fc0-c712eeee2f1d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2c16e1b2-70e5-4bc6-8fc0-c712eeee2f1d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":30,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:6bdecc67-aab6-436d-aeea-06f401521b23","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001002755.4(NFU1):c.565G>A (p.Gly189Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA347123544"}},{"id":"cggv:9b52a438-ae7c-422a-8747-592ee6f67b9d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001002755.4(NFU1):c.568G>A (p.Gly190Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA347123538"}}],"detectionMethod":"c.565G>A; p.Gly189Arg\nc.568G>A; p.Gly190Arg\t\nNeither variant is reported in gnomAD v3.1.2\n","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002154","obo:HP_0002104","obo:HP_0000648","obo:HP_0002092","obo:HP_0001285","obo:HP_0002015","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0002352"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:7713365c-6bd9-47dd-9e9c-936e82126295_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9b52a438-ae7c-422a-8747-592ee6f67b9d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25918518","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Disorders of the mitochondrial energy metabolism are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. An increasingly recognized subgroup is caused by defective mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biosynthesis, with defects in 13 genes being linked to human disease to date. Mutations in three of them, NFU1, BOLA3, and IBA57, affect the assembly of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins leading to an impairment of diverse mitochondrial metabolic pathways and ATP production. Patients with defects in these three genes present with lactic acidosis, hyperglycinemia, and reduced activities of respiratory chain complexes I and II, the four lipoic acid-dependent 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and the glycine cleavage system (GCS). To date, five different NFU1 pathogenic variants have been reported in 15 patients from 12 families. We report on seven new patients from five families carrying compound heterozygous or homozygous pathogenic NFU1 mutations identified by candidate gene screening and exome sequencing. Six out of eight different disease alleles were novel and functional studies were performed to support the pathogenicity of five of them. Characteristic clinical features included fatal infantile encephalopathy and pulmonary hypertension leading to death within the first 6 months of life in six out of seven patients. Laboratory investigations revealed combined defects of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (five out of five) and respiratory chain complexes I and II+III (four out of five) in skeletal muscle and/or cultured skin fibroblasts as well as increased lactate (five out of six) and glycine concentration (seven out of seven). Our study contributes to a better definition of the phenotypic spectrum associated with NFU1 mutations and to the diagnostic workup of future patients.","dc:creator":"Ahting U","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Clinical, biochemical, and genetic spectrum of seven patients with NFU1 deficiency."}},{"id":"cggv:765b2dec-25fa-4e96-8aca-f5e5a46ae102_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6bdecc67-aab6-436d-aeea-06f401521b23"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25918518"}],"rdfs:label":"Ahting et al patient 2"},{"id":"cggv:7713365c-6bd9-47dd-9e9c-936e82126295","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7713365c-6bd9-47dd-9e9c-936e82126295_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:7713365c-6bd9-47dd-9e9c-936e82126295_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"0.1 (rare missense variant) + 0.4 (PDH deficiency - 20% control) + 0.4 (I and II+III deficiency in muscle, I 0%; II+III 25%)"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"0.1 (rare missense variant) + 0.4 (PDH deficiency - 20% control) + 0.4 (I and II+III deficiency in muscle, I 0%; II+III 25%)"},{"id":"cggv:765b2dec-25fa-4e96-8aca-f5e5a46ae102","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:765b2dec-25fa-4e96-8aca-f5e5a46ae102_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:765b2dec-25fa-4e96-8aca-f5e5a46ae102_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"0.1 (rare missense variant) + 0.4 (PDH deficiency - 20% control) + 0.4 (I and II+III deficiency in muscle, I 0%; II+III 25%)\n"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"0.1 (rare missense variant) + 0.4 (PDH deficiency - 20% control) + 0.4 (I and II+III deficiency in muscle, I 0%; II+III 25%)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:af954de7-40fe-46c8-8af3-92f6153a76a5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:af954de7-40fe-46c8-8af3-92f6153a76a5","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"cggv:61b42819-4ff8-444c-a2c2-9767aac30713","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001002755.4(NFU1):c.622G>T (p.Gly208Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129406"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002092","obo:HP_0002154","obo:HP_0002151","obo:HP_0001508"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:3a38a606-9b13-400f-a2cd-3718c7d60c5a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:61b42819-4ff8-444c-a2c2-9767aac30713"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22077971","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We report on ten individuals with a fatal infantile encephalopathy and/or pulmonary hypertension, leading to death before the age of 15 months. Hyperglycinemia and lactic acidosis were common findings. Glycine cleavage system and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) activities were low. Homozygosity mapping revealed a perfectly overlapping homozygous region of 1.24 Mb corresponding to chromosome 2 and led to the identification of a homozygous missense mutation (c.622G > T) in NFU1, which encodes a conserved protein suggested to participate in Fe-S cluster biogenesis. Nine individuals were homozygous for this mutation, whereas one was compound heterozygous for this and a splice-site (c.545 + 5G > A) mutation. The biochemical phenotype suggested an impaired activity of the Fe-S enzyme lipoic acid synthase (LAS). Direct measurement of protein-bound lipoic acid in individual tissues indeed showed marked decreases. Upon depletion of NFU1 by RNA interference in human cell culture, LAS and, in turn, PDHC activities were largely diminished. In addition, the amount of succinate dehydrogenase, but no other Fe-S proteins, was decreased. In contrast, depletion of the general Fe-S scaffold protein ISCU severely affected assembly of all tested Fe-S proteins, suggesting that NFU1 performs a specific function in mitochondrial Fe-S cluster maturation. Similar biochemical effects were observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae upon deletion of NFU1, resulting in lower lipoylation and SDH activity. Importantly, yeast Nfu1 protein carrying the individuals' missense mutation was functionally impaired. We conclude that NFU1 functions as a late-acting maturation factor for a subset of mitochondrial Fe-S proteins.","dc:creator":"Navarro-Sastre A","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"A fatal mitochondrial disease is associated with defective NFU1 function in the maturation of a subset of mitochondrial Fe-S proteins."}},"rdfs:label":"Navarro-Sastre et al P6"},{"id":"cggv:3a38a606-9b13-400f-a2cd-3718c7d60c5a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3a38a606-9b13-400f-a2cd-3718c7d60c5a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:3a38a606-9b13-400f-a2cd-3718c7d60c5a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Basque Founder Variant "}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Basque Founder Variant "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:6c45407f-4ab1-429a-886e-191862aea25b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6c45407f-4ab1-429a-886e-191862aea25b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":1,"allele":{"id":"cggv:f8878bb1-6cbd-4a1f-806c-0f054e3f2ea2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001002755.4(NFU1):c.545G>A (p.Arg182Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA347123809"}},"detectionMethod":"The c.545G>A; p.

The mutation results in abnormal mRNA splicing of exon 6, and no mature protein could be detected in fibroblast mitochondria. A single base-pair duplication c.123dupA was identified in BOLA3 in the second family, causing a frame shift that produces a premature stop codon (p.Glu42Argfs(∗)13). Transduction of fibroblast lines with retroviral vectors expressing the mitochondrial, but not the cytosolic isoform of NFU1 and with isoform 1, but not isoform 2 of BOLA3 restored both respiratory chain function and oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes. NFU1 was previously proposed to be an alternative scaffold to ISCU for the biogenesis of [Fe-S] centers in mitochondria, and the function of BOLA3 was previously unknown.

Their versatile functions may go back to the proposed role of their Fe/S cofactors in the origin of life as efficient catalysts and electron carriers. More than two decades ago, it was discovered that the in vivo synthesis of cellular Fe/S clusters and their integration into polypeptide chains requires assistance by complex proteinaceous machineries, despite the fact that Fe/S proteins can be assembled chemically in vitro. In prokaryotes, three Fe/S protein biogenesis systems are known; ISC, SUF, and the more specialized NIF. The former two systems have been transferred by endosymbiosis from bacteria to mitochondria and plastids, respectively, of eukaryotes. In their cytosol, eukaryotes use the CIA machinery for the biogenesis of cytosolic and nuclear Fe/S proteins. Despite the structural diversity of the protein constituents of these four machineries, general mechanistic concepts underlie the complex process of Fe/S protein biogenesis. This review provides a comprehensive and comparative overview of the various known biogenesis systems in Biology, and summarizes their common or diverging molecular mechanisms, thereby illustrating both the conservation and diverse adaptions of these four machineries during evolution and under different lifestyles. Knowledge of these fundamental biochemical pathways is not only of basic scientific interest, but is important for the understanding of human 'Fe/S diseases' and can be used in biotechnology.","dc:creator":"Braymer JJ","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Mechanistic concepts of iron-sulfur protein biogenesis in Biology."},"rdfs:label":"Iron Sulfur Cluster Pathway Gene Interactions"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10 proteins from complexes I, II, iron sulfur cluster proteins, and lipoylated proteins (i.e PDHc)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:1adb01f7-d226-4f55-ab00-adb513c20e80_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:34eda49b-f13f-4673-8d24-78add6444ab0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:943910a8-c772-460d-b506-845542b6f294","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"mean activity of the enzyme in the affected individual was low (0.50 nmol/mg protein/min), while the mean activity in the mother was normal (0.82 nmol/mg protein/min, normal range 0.6-0.9 nmol/mg protein/min). \n\nWestern blot analysis on fibroblast samples showed that subunits of each complex of the electron transport chain (CI-CIV) were decreased in the affected individual F1-II:1 compared to the heterozygous mother (F1-I:1) and a pediatric control, whereas levels of complex V subunit ATP5A remained relatively unchanged","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36256512","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Bi-allelic variants in Iron-Sulfur Cluster Scaffold (NFU1) have previously been associated with multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome 1 (MMDS1) characterized by early-onset rapidly fatal leukoencephalopathy.

Tissue testing indicated a clear reduction in lipoate containing 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases (pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) as well as defects in complexes I, II, and III which is characteristic of this Fe-S cluster defect.   While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NFU1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NFU1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included six unique variants (two frameshift null variants, three missense variants, and one predicted missense variant resulting in aberrant splicing) in five probands from three publications (PMIDs: 22077971, 25918518, 25758857), although many additional cases (~35) are reported in the medical literature. The p.Gly208Cys variant appears to be a Basque founder variant. Affected individuals have a strikingly similar biochemical phenotype but variable severity of their clinical phenotype. Two general clinical phenotypes have been reported. One is an infantile onset, potentially fatal, lactic acidosis with leukoencephalopathy with or without pulmonary hypertension, optic atrophy, and/or cardiomyopathy. The second is an early childhood onset hereditary spastic paraplegia with leukoencephalopathy and regression. Affected individuals show a reduction in activities and amounts of lipoate containing enzymes as well as hyperglycinemia/hyperglycinuria (PMIDs: 22077971, 25918518, 25758857). \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by functional implication given protein interaction with other genes involved in Fe-S cluster assembly or lipoylation (PMID: 33007329). HeLa cell models and yeast cell models replicating similar biochemical defects seen in patients (PMID: 22077971) and functional deficiencies seen in patient cells (PMID:36256512) were also included in scoring. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *NFU1* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 11, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1adb01f7-d226-4f55-ab00-adb513c20e80"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
