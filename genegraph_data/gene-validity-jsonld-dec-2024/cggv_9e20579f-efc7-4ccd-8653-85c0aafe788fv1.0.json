Heart failure usually results from dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). DCM of unknown cause in families has recently been shown to result from genetic disease, highlighting newly discovered disease mechanisms. AD is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease of older Americans. Familial AD is caused most commonly by presenilin 1 (PSEN1) or presenilin 2 (PSEN2) mutations, a discovery that has greatly advanced the field. The presenilins are also expressed in the heart and are critical to cardiac development. We hypothesized that mutations in presenilins may also be associated with DCM and that their discovery could provide new insight into the pathogenesis of DCM and heart failure. A total of 315 index patients with DCM were evaluated for sequence variation in PSEN1 and PSEN2. Families positive for mutations underwent additional clinical, genetic, and functional studies. A novel PSEN1 missense mutation (Asp333Gly) was identified in one family, and a single PSEN2 missense mutation (Ser130Leu) was found in two other families. Both mutations segregated with DCM and heart failure. The PSEN1 mutation was associated with complete penetrance and progressive disease that resulted in the necessity of cardiac transplantation or in death. The PSEN2 mutation showed partial penetrance, milder disease, and a more favorable prognosis. Calcium signaling was altered in cultured skin fibroblasts from PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutation carriers. These data indicate that PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations are associated with DCM and heart failure and implicate novel mechanisms of myocardial disease.","dc:creator":"Li D","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Mutations of presenilin genes in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17186461","rdfs:label":"III.5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:991cd6ab-837b-4785-873d-1b04b5d5a9dd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4313fe03-8713-4935-aa6a-a0309486bbf8","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Screening of PSEN1 and PSEN2","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:991cd6ab-837b-4785-873d-1b04b5d5a9dd_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:abb883b2-fe5c-4e54-a4cd-409e8f5c53b3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000447.3(PSEN2):c.185G>A (p.Arg62His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA224946"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20194882","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Heart failure is a debilitating condition resulting in severe disability and death.

Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and segregation data. Evaluated case data includes the first PSEN2-DCM paper which evaluated a total of 315 index patients with DCM for sequence variation in PSEN1 and PSEN2. A single PSEN2 missense variant (Ser130Leu) was found in two families. Both variants segregated with DCM and heart failure. The PSEN2 variant showed partial penetrance. Calcium signaling was altered in cultured skin fibroblasts from PSEN2 mutation carriers. In addition, a study of 42 patients with familial DCM (Minoche et al, 2018, PMID: 29961767) comparing genome sequencing with panel sequencing, identified a single individual with a PSEN2 variant (Arg71Trp) which was classified as likely benign. The same individual was a carrier of 3 TTN and one LAMA2 variant, all classified as variants of unknown significance. In addition, this gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence. PSEN2 variants were identified in a study (Gianni et al, 2010, PMID: 20194882) where hearts of DCM patients were studied for fibrillar and oligomeric assemblies. A single variant (Arg62His) was identified in two of the 20 cases studied with genetic analysis. Another experimental study (Takeda et al, 2005, PMID: 16204356) with PSEN2-knockout mice failed to show the development of DCM or any histopathological alterations such as myocardial hypertrophy or fibrosis in these animals. Invasive hemodynamic analysis revealed that cardiac contractility in PS2KO mice increased compared with that in their littermate controls. Due to the lack of a phenotype this study was excluded. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of PSEN2 with autosomal dominant DCM. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on December 13, 2019 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9e20579f-efc7-4ccd-8653-85c0aafe788f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
