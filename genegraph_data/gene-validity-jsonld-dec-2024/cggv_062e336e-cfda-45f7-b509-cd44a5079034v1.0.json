To examine whether these different clinical forms could be explained by different ETF/ETFDH mutations that result in different levels of residual ETF/ETFDH enzyme activity, we have investigated the molecular genetic basis for disease development in nine patients representing the phenotypic spectrum of MADD. We report the genomic structures of the ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH genes and the identification and characterization of seven novel and three previously reported disease-causing mutations. Our molecular genetic investigations of these nine patients are consistent with three clinical forms of MADD showing a clear relationship between the nature of the mutations and the severity of disease. Interestingly, our data suggest that homozygosity for two null mutations causes fetal development of congenital anomalies resulting in a type I disease phenotype. Even minute amounts of residual ETF/ETFDH activity seem to be sufficient to prevent embryonic development of congenital anomalies giving rise to type II disease. Overexpression studies of an ETFB-D128N missense mutation identified in a patient with type III disease showed that the residual activity of the mutant enzyme could be rescued up to 59% of that of wild-type activity when ETFB-D128N-transformed E. coli cells were grown at low temperature. This indicates that the effect of the ETF/ETFDH genotype in patients with milder forms of MADD, in whom residual enzyme activity allows modulation of the enzymatic phenotype, may be influenced by environmental factors like cellular temperature.","dc:creator":"Olsen RK","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Clear relationship between ETF/ETFDH genotype and phenotype in patients with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12815589","rdfs:label":"Patient 8"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The c.51dupT variant causes a frameshift (p.Ala18CysfsX5), creating a premature Stop codon.

Some patients respond to pharmacological doses of riboflavin. It is unknown whether these patients have defects in the flavoproteins themselves or defects in the formation of the cofactor, FAD, from riboflavin. We report 15 patients from 11 pedigrees. All the index cases presented with encephalopathy or muscle weakness or a combination of these symptoms; several had previously suffered cyclical vomiting. Urine organic acid and plasma acyl-carnitine profiles indicated MADD. Clinical and biochemical parameters were either totally or partly corrected after riboflavin treatment. All patients had mutations in the gene for ETF:QO. In one patient, we show that the ETF:QO mutations are associated with a riboflavin-sensitive impairment of ETF:QO activity. This patient also had partial deficiencies of flavin-dependent acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and respiratory chain complexes, most of which were restored to control levels after riboflavin treatment.

Binding of these inhibitory proteins prevents binding of the positive splicing regulatory SRSF1 and SRSF5 proteins to nearby and overlapping exonic splicing enhancer elements and this causes exon skipping. We further suggest that binding of hnRNP proteins to UAGGGA is increased by triggering synergistic hnRNP H binding to GGG triplets located upstream and downsteam of the UAGGGA motif.

The latter reaction is inhibited by rotenone and carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone and all three reactions are inhibited by antibody to electrontransfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QO). These observations indicated that ETF-QO reacts with the pool of ubiquinone that is reduced by NADH and succinic dehydrogenases. Consistent with this hypothesis, NADH- and succinic-ETF reductase activities are inhibited 99% in ubiquinone-depleted particles, and reincorporation of exogenous ubiquinone restores at least 90% of these activities. Reduction of the bc1 complex by ETF and acyl CoA oxidase activity are also inhibited by antibody to ETF-QO. Myxothiazole and antimycin which inhibit the quinonol oxidation and quinone reduction sites, respectively, in the bc1 complex also inhibit electron transport from ETF-QO through the complex according to current models of the Q-cycle (Rich, P.R. (1986) J. Bioenerg. Biomembranes 18, 145-156). The results show that ETF-QO is an obligatory component of the electron transport pathway between ETF and the ubiquinone pool and suggest a mechanism for the steady-state turnover of ETF-QO.","dc:creator":"Frerman FE","dc:date":"1987","dc:title":"Reaction of electron-transfer flavoprotein ubiquinone oxidoreductase with the mitochondrial respiratory chain."},"rdfs:label":"Frerman 1987 Biochemical"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:062e336e-cfda-45f7-b509-cd44a5079034_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d32bdb55-f425-4528-9733-c3c5926ea0e6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7be3d9d3-74a7-4bb5-afe6-3c3836dbac64","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"All ETFDH variations tested compromise the ETF-QO enzyme amount and activity to various extent.

It was only recently established that a number of RR-MADD patients carry genetic defects in ETF-QO and that the well-documented clinical efficacy of riboflavin treatment may be based on a chaperone effect that can compensate for inherited folding defects of ETF-QO. In the present study, we investigate the molecular mechanisms and the genotype-phenotype relationships for the riboflavin responsiveness in MADD, using a human HEK-293 cell expression system. We studied the influence of riboflavin and temperature on the steady-state level and the activity of variant ETF-QO proteins identified in patients with RR-MADD, or non- and partially responsive MADD. Our results showed that variant ETF-QO proteins associated with non- and partially responsive MADD caused severe misfolding of ETF-QO variant proteins when cultured in media with supplemented concentrations of riboflavin. In contrast, variant ETF-QO proteins associated with RR-MADD caused milder folding defects when cultured at the same conditions. Decreased thermal stability of the variants showed that FAD does not completely correct the structural defects induced by the variation. This may cause leakage of electrons and increased reactive oxygen species, as reflected by increased amounts of cellular peroxide production in HEK-293 cells expressing the variant ETF-QO proteins. Finally, we found indications of prolonged association of variant ETF-QO protein with the Hsp60 chaperonin in the mitochondrial matrix, supporting indications of folding defects in the variant ETF-QO proteins.","dc:creator":"Cornelius N","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Molecular mechanisms of riboflavin responsiveness in patients with ETF-QO variations and multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Cornelius 2012"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e3d1613f-9606-4961-befa-f2db1ea7c76a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5e64ef3a-2235-4709-90d2-89e33db4ddd8","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"On Western blot control fibroblast membranes had ETF-QO present while in patients 1691, 1716, and 1730 the polypeptide is absent.

Antisera were raised to purified porcine electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) and electron transfer flavoprotein:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF:QO). The antisera were used to detect the two electron transferases in control and GA II fibroblasts by immunoblotting. Fibroblasts from three unrelated GA II patients were deficient in immunologically detectable ETF:QO and extracts from these three fibroblast lines contained no detectable ETF:QO catalytic activity. Fibroblasts from parents of two of these patients had ETF:QO activity intermediate between activities in control fibroblasts and fibroblasts from the patients. These data indicate that the primary defect in these patients is a deficiency of ETF:QO and that the mode of transmission of the gene is autosomal recessive. Fibroblasts from two other patients with severe GA II had normal levels of ETF-QO activity and antigen but were deficient in immunoreactive ETF. These findings show that GA II results from a deficiency of ETF in some patients and ETF:QO in others.

The mutants are allelic to the CG12140 gene, the fly homologue of electron transfer flavoprotein:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF:QO). In humans, inherited defects in this inner membrane protein account for multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), a metabolic disease of β-oxidation, with a broad range of clinical phenotypes, varying from embryonic lethal to mild forms. The three mutant alleles carried distinct missense mutations in ETF:QO (G65E, A68V and S104F) and maternal mutant embryos for ETF:QO showed lethal morphogenetic defects and a significant induction of apoptosis following germ-band elongation. This phenotype is accompanied by an embryonic accumulation of short- and medium-chain acylcarnitines (C4, C8 and C12) as well as long-chain acylcarnitines (C14 and C16:1), whose elevation is also found in severe MADD forms in humans under intense metabolic decompensation. In agreement the ETF:QO activity in the mutant embryos is markedly decreased in relation to wild type activity. Amino acid sequence analysis and structural mapping into a molecular model of ETF:QO show that all mutations map at FAD interacting residues, two of which at the nucleotide-binding Rossmann fold. This structural domain is composed by a β-strand connected by a short loop to an α-helix, and its perturbation results in impaired cofactor association via structural destabilisation and consequently enzymatic inactivation.

Strikingly, a PPARG antagonist attenuates aberrant neural proliferation and alleviates paralysis in xav, while PPARG agonists increase neural proliferation in wild type embryos.
