The function of BMP signal transduction within the pulmonary vasculature and the role BMPrII mutations have in the development of PAH are incompletely understood. We used the monocrotaline (MCT) model of PAH to examine alterations in Smad signal transduction pathways in vivo. Lungs harvested from Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single 60-mg/kg intraperitoneal (IP) injection of MCT were compared to saline-treated controls 2 weeks following treatment. Smad 4 was localized by immunohistochemistry to endothelial nuclei of the intra-acinar vessels undergoing remodeling. Smad 4, common to both BMP and transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling, and BMP-specific Smad 1 were significantly decreased in western blot from whole lungs of treated animals, while no change was found for TGFbeta-specific Smad 2. MCT-treated rats also had increased expression of phosphorylated Smad 1 (P-Smad 1) but not phosphorylated Smad 2 (P-Smad 2). There was a decrease in the expression of the full BMPrII protein but not its short form variant in MCT-treated rat lungs. The type I receptor Alk1 had increased expression. Collectively, our data indicate that vascular remodeling in the MCT model is associated with alterations in BMP receptors and persistent endothelial Smad 1 signaling.","dc:creator":"Ramos MF","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Smad signaling in the rat model of monocrotaline pulmonary hypertension."},"rdfs:label":"SMAD signaling in Monocrotaline induced PH in rats"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:12d82f9f-8ab2-4012-a5d5-20de99f23c07_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":5359,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":0.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:755a51c9-ed43-4d45-80a9-c7d7eb311eed","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0015924","gene":"hgnc:6770","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"SMAD4 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in 2011 (Nasim et al., PMID:21898662) in a cohort of PAH patients without BMPR2 variants and screened for variants in SMAD candidate genes. In total, four SMAD4 variants (missense, non-canonical splice, and in frame deletion) have been reported (PMIDs: 21898662, 31727138). However, none of the variants were scorable. The relationship between SMAD4 and PAH is supported by SMAD4 biochemical function in rats with pulmonary hypertension (PMID:18367643). However, the gene-disease relationship betwen SMAD4 and PAH is classified as disputed due to insufficient genetic evidence over multiple years of research. This classification was approved by the ClinGen PH Gene Curation Expert Panel on 8/30/2022 (SOP Version 9).\nOnly two probands have been reported with HPAH/IPAH and SMAD4 variants. There is limited experimental evidence for biochemical function in a PAH-related pathway. Therefore, SMAD4 is classified as disputed for PAH based upon insufficient genetic evidence over multiple years of research.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:12d82f9f-8ab2-4012-a5d5-20de99f23c07"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
