An abnormal coagulation/fibrinolysis system, associated with elevated thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor, indicated the presence of severe, persistent endothelial damage. Electron microscopy of renal glomeruli revealed detachment of endothelium, with subendothelial deposition of an unidentified material. Iron deposition was noted in renal and hepatic tissue. Immunohistochemistry of hepatic tissue and immunoblotting of a cadmium-stimulated Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) revealed complete absence of HO-1 production. An LCL derived from the patient was extremely sensitive to hemin-induced cell injury. Sequence analysis of the patient's HO-1 gene revealed complete loss of exon-2 of the maternal allele and a two-nucleotide deletion within exon3 of the paternal allele. Growth retardation, anemia, iron deposition, and vulnerability to stressful injury are all characteristics observed in recently described HO-1 targeted mice.

The primary features of this condition include recurrent fever, hemolytic anemia, low serum bilirubin, elevated serum ferritin, and small or absent spleen. The underlying mechanism is a loss of heme oxidase activity leading to increased susceptibility to oxidative damage (PMID: 20055707).\n\nSix variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site, whole exon deletion) that have been reported in five probands in five publications (PMIDs: 9884342; 210818618; 26526137; 32587840; 33066778) are included in this curation. Co-segregation with disease has not been observed. The mechanism of pathogenicity is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by the known biological function of HMOX1, its expression pattern, functional alterations in patient and non-patient cells, and a non-human animal model (PMIDs: 9380735; 9380736; 9884342; 20055707; 25613900). \n\nIn summary, HMOX1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive heme oxygenase deficiency 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP on 12/18/2023 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9f1a1080-6e62-4c89-9500-e5c74e078e06"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
