Concurrently, all patient mtDNAs were screened for the common primary LHON mtDNA mutations at nucleotide pairs (nps) 3460, 11778, and 14484, the ambiguous intermediate-risk LHON mtDNA mutations at nps 5244 and 15257, and the secondary LHON mtDNA mutations at nps 3394, 4216, 4917, 7444, 13708, and 15812. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using mtDNA haplotype data from the 47 LHON patients and 175 non-LHON Caucasian controls. The superimposition of the LHON mutation screening results upon the Caucasian mtDNA phylogeny revealed (1) 35 different LHON haplotypes, (2) that all three common primary mutations have occurred multiple times in Caucasians, (3) that while recurrent mutation is common for the primary mutations, secondary mutations tend to be lineage-specific, (4) that the np 15257 mutation was confined to a single mtDNA lineage but may be etiologically important in some LHON cases since it was found in a LHON pedigree which lacked a common primary mutation; complete sequence analysis of the proband mtDNA revealed only a single other candidate missense mutation (at np 10663 of the ND4L gene) of uncertain pathological significance; and (5) that the np 14484 mutation may be less pathogenic than either the np 3460 or np 11778 mutations, as this mutation most commonly occurred on a single mtDNA lineage and almost always in association with secondary LHON mutations. A phylogenetic approach to this genetically heterogeneous disease has thus provided key genetic data bearing on the relative pathogenicity of the LHON-associated mtDNA mutations.","dc:creator":"Brown MD","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Phylogenetic analysis of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy mitochondrial DNA's indicates multiple independent occurrences of the common mutations."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:315cca07-6aef-4749-abf2-c0eba7d6c1c5_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:315cca07-6aef-4749-abf2-c0eba7d6c1c5_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6dbab484-596d-4fb9-90c5-19168f2f9469","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:07a69ef5-2ce7-4181-88d0-ab54961d7038","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":">45 complex I genes, including catalytic subunits, assembly factor, iron/sulfur proteins and >10+ involved in disease","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27509854","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), one of the largest membrane-bound enzymes in the cell, powers ATP synthesis in mammalian mitochondria by using the reducing potential of NADH to drive protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mammalian complex I (ref. 1) contains 45 subunits, comprising 14 core subunits that house the catalytic machinery (and are conserved from bacteria to humans) and a mammalian-specific cohort of 31 supernumerary subunits. Knowledge of the structures and functions of the supernumerary subunits is fragmentary. Here we describe a 4.2-Ã… resolution single-particle electron cryomicroscopy structure of complex I from Bos taurus. We have located and modelled all 45 subunits, including the 31 supernumerary subunits, to provide the entire structure of the mammalian complex. Computational sorting of the particles identified different structural classes, related by subtle domain movements, which reveal conformationally dynamic regions and match biochemical descriptions of the 'active-to-de-active' enzyme transition that occurs during hypoxia. Our structures therefore provide a foundation for understanding complex I assembly and the effects of mutations that cause clinically relevant complex I dysfunctions, give insights into the structural and functional roles of the supernumerary subunits and reveal new information on the mechanism and regulation of catalysis.","dc:creator":"Zhu J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Structure of mammalian respiratory complex I."},"rdfs:label":"Cryo EM Mammalian Complex I"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">45 complex I genes, including catalytic subunits, assembly factor, iron/sulfur proteins and  >10+ involved in disease"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:315cca07-6aef-4749-abf2-c0eba7d6c1c5_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":6179,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":5.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:51a0b556-26d4-4d1d-87a8-5e88e570c867","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:7460","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001427"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *MT-ND4L* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of October 20, 2022. The *MT-ND4L* gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) core subunit ND4L. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. This gene is located at position m.10470-10766 of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heavy strand. Of note, seven nucleotides overlap the last three codons of *MT-ND4L* and the first three codons of *MT-ND4*. No pathogenic variants have been reported in this overlap region. \n\n*MT-ND4L* was first reported in relation to maternally inherited primary mitochondrial disease in two families with Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) in 1995 (PMID: 8680405). These families were first reported in 1994 (PMID: 7977345), but the genetic etiology was not identified until 1995. In subsequent work, cybrid analyses were performed for m.10663T>C which showed a mild impact on complex I function similar to the order of magnitude seen with m.14484T>C, one of the three most common LHON-associated variants (PMID: 11935318). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-ND4L*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-ND4L* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included seven probands with m.10063T>C across five publications, all of whom had LHON (PMIDs: 8680405, 11935318, 17003408, 22879922, 24568867). These cases were scored with reduced points given the mild impact this variant has been shown to have on complex I function (PMID: 11935318). While three other missense variants (m.10543A>G, m.10591T>G, m.10680G>A) have been reported, this Expert Panel agreed there was only sufficient evidence of pathogenicity for the m.10663T>C variant (indeed, this variant is classified as likely pathogenic by the ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Variant Curation Expert Panel). Cases with m.10680G>A (PMID: 29444077) and m.10543A>G and m.10591T>G (PMID: 17003408) were reviewed but excluded from scoring due to a lack of compelling functional evidence to support pathogenicity. The m.10543A>G variant has been modeled in E. coli and showed a very mild reduction in NADH dehydrogenase activity (74% of control; PMID: 35306226), which was not sufficient to be included in scoring. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by its known biochemical function as a complex I subunit.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. Furthermore, this Gene Curation Expert Panel notes that, while variants in this gene have only been seen in those with LHON to date, additional cases and expansion of the phenotypic spectrum are likely to be seen in the future given the critical role of the ND4L subunit in complex I function. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 20, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:315cca07-6aef-4749-abf2-c0eba7d6c1c5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
