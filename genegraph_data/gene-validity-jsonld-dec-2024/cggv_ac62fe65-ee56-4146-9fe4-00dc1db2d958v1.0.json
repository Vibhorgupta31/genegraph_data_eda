Although alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) is a synthetase implicated in a wide range of neurological disorders from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease to infantile epileptic encephalopathy, there have been limited data on their pathogenesis. Here, we report loss-of-function mutations in AARS in two siblings with progressive microcephaly with hypomyelination, intractable epilepsy, and spasticity.

A lymphoblastoid cell line developed from one of the affected individuals showed a strong reduction in AARS abundance. The mutations decrease aminoacylation efficiency by 70%-90%. The p.Tyr690Leufs*3 mutation also abolished editing activity required for hydrolyzing misacylated tRNAs, thereby increasing errors during aminoacylation.

Analysis by whole exome sequencing identified mutations in the nuclear-encodedÂ alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) in these two unrelated families: the two affected siblings are compound heterozygous for p.Lys81Thr and p.Arg751Gly AARS, and the single affected child is homozygous for p.Arg751Gly AARS. The two identified mutations were found to result in a significant reduction in function. Mutations in AARS were previously associated with an autosomal-dominant inherited form of axonal neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2N (CMT2N). The autosomal-recessive AARS mutations identified in the individuals described here, however, cause a severe infantile epileptic encephalopathy with a central myelin defect and peripheral neuropathy, demonstrating that defects of alanyl-tRNA charging can result in a wide spectrum of disease manifestations.

Variants in AARS were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2015 (Simons et al., PMID 25817015). At least 1 frameshift and 3 missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 3 probands in 2 publications (PMID: 25817015, 28493438). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by functional studies that show variants' affects on yeast growth and catalytic efficiency in patient-derived cell lines. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
