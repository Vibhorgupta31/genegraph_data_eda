During Drosophila intestine development, cells undergo a dramatic reduction in cell size and clearance of mitochondria that depends on autophagy, the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme Uba1, and ubiquitin [2]. Here we screen a collection of putative ubiquitin-binding domain-encoding genes for cell size reduction and autophagy phenotypes. We identify the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) components TSG101 and Vps36, as well as the novel gene Vps13D. Vps13D is an essential gene that is necessary for autophagy, mitochondrial size, and mitochondrial clearance in Drosophila. Interestingly, a similar mitochondrial phenotype is observed in VPS13D mutant human cells. The ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of Vps13D binds K63 ubiquitin chains, and mutants lacking the UBA domain have defects in mitochondrial size and clearance and exhibit semi-lethality, highlighting the importance of Vps13D ubiquitin binding in both mitochondrial health and development. VPS13D mutant cells possess phosphorylated DRP1 and mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) as well as DRP1 association with mitochondria, suggesting that VPS13D functions downstream of these known regulators of mitochondrial fission. In addition, the large Vps13D mitochondrial and cell size phenotypes are suppressed by decreased mitochondrial fusion gene function. Thus, these results provide a previously unknown link between ubiquitin, mitochondrial size regulation, and autophagy.","dc:creator":"Anding AL","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Vps13D Encodes a Ubiquitin-Binding Protein that Is Required for the Regulation of Mitochondrial Size and Clearance."},"rdfs:label":"Fission function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"VSPD13 shares a similar function to 2-5 genes implicated in causing Leigh syndrome (Awarded 1 pt)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:7f179add-fcdb-4ea0-bc3c-506f825d2dac_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c51ccd59-2529-479d-a009-f5b3c4709e58","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7b4444ea-4d3a-4d69-9799-5457a363c019","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Patient fibroblasts showed altered mitochondrial morphology and functionality including reduced ATP production","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29604224","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To identify novel causes of recessive ataxias, including spinocerebellar ataxia with saccadic intrusions, spastic ataxias, and spastic paraplegia.","dc:creator":"Seong E","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mutations in VPS13D lead to a new recessive ataxia with spasticity and mitochondrial defects."},"rdfs:label":"Patient derived fibroblasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"More than one patient cell line demonstrating mitochondrial dysfunction (Score 1.5 pts)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:7f179add-fcdb-4ea0-bc3c-506f825d2dac_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be899b29-f9a4-492d-b04e-9cacf18f1b2a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:74164777-db05-43d7-adc9-e95be206da2e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Flies demonstrated early mortality and abnormal mitochondria that can be  seen in Leigh syndrome ","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29604224","rdfs:label":"VPS13D fly"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This model recapitulated the early mortality and abnormal mitochondria often seen in Leigh syndrome (0.5 pts per phenotype = 1 pt)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":2919,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":3.75,"subject":{"id":"cggv:3c9b9aee-f92f-4588-bfa7-f3308589e62d","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009723","gene":"hgnc:23595","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between VPS13D and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of May 24, 2021. The VPS13D gene encodes vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog D, which has been shown to be critical to mitochondrial stability, fission, and clearance by mitophagy.\n\nThe VPS13D gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2018 (PMID: 29518281). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 29518281). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 29307555, 29604224, 29604224).\n \nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
