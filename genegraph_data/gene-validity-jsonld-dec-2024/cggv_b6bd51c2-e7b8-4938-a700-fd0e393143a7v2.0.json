NM is thought to be a disease of sarcomeric thin filaments as six of eight known genes whose mutation can cause NM encode components of that structure, however, recent discoveries of mutations in non-thin filament genes has called this model in question. We performed whole-exome sequencing and have identified recessive small deletions and missense changes in the Kelch-like family member 41 gene (KLHL41) in four individuals from unrelated NM families. Sanger sequencing of 116 unrelated individuals with NM identified compound heterozygous changes in KLHL41 in a fifth family. Mutations in KLHL41 showed a clear phenotype-genotype correlation: Frameshift mutations resulted in severe phenotypes with neonatal death, whereas missense changes resulted in impaired motor function with survival into late childhood and/or early adulthood. Functional studies in zebrafish showed that loss of Klhl41 results in highly diminished motor function and myofibrillar disorganization, with nemaline body formation, the pathological hallmark of NM. These studies expand the genetic heterogeneity of NM and implicate a critical role of BTB-Kelch family members in maintenance of sarcomeric integrity in NM.

At least 8 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, frameshift, large deletion) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Summary of Case Level Data: 3.5 POINTS. Variants in this gene have been curated from 5 probands in 3 publications ( PMID: 24268659, 28939701, 28749478). The mechanism for the disease is homozygous loss of function (PMID: 24268659). This gene-disease association is supported by a mouse model (PMID: 28826497) which recapitulates disease as well as a zebrafish myopathy model which was rescued by expression of human *KLHL41* (PMID: 24268659). Additionally, the function of KLHL41 in regulation of the thin filaments (PMIDs: 28826497, 30986853) its expression in skeletal muscle (PMID: 28826497), and its interaction with components of the sarcomere (PMID: 28826497), all provide further evidence. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the CM GCEP on 11/5/2019. It was reevaluated on 10/21/2024. As a result of this reevaluation no new evidence was identified and the classification remained at Moderate (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b6bd51c2-e7b8-4938-a700-fd0e393143a7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
