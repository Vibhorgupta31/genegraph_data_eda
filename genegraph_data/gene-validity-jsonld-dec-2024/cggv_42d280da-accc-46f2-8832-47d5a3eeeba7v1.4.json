Deletion of RyR2 amino acid residues 3583-3603 resulted in background [35S]CaM binding levels.

Here, we investigated the effect of CaM mutations causing CPVT (N53I), long QT syndrome (D95V and D129G), or both (CaM N97S) on RyR2-mediated Ca(2+) release. All mutations increased Ca(2+) release and rendered RyR2 more susceptible to store overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR) by lowering the threshold of store Ca(2+) content at which SOICR occurred and the threshold at which SOICR terminated. To obtain mechanistic insights, we investigated the Ca(2+) binding of the N- and C-terminal domains (N- and C-domain) of CaM in the presence of a peptide corresponding to the CaM-binding domain of RyR2. The N53I mutation decreased the affinity of Ca(2+) binding to the N-domain of CaM, relative to CaM WT, but did not affect the C-domain. Conversely, mutations N97S, D95V, and D129G had little or no effect on Ca(2+) binding to the N-domain but markedly decreased the affinity of the C-domain for Ca(2+). These results suggest that mutations D95V, N97S, and D129G alter the interaction between CaM and the CaMBD and thus RyR2 regulation. Because the N53I mutation minimally affected Ca(2+) binding to the C-domain, it must cause aberrant regulation via a different mechanism. These results support aberrant RyR2 regulation as the disease mechanism for CPVT associated with CaM mutations and shows that CaM mutations not associated with CPVT can also affect RyR2. A model for the CaM-RyR2 interaction, where the Ca(2+)-saturated C-domain is constitutively bound to RyR2 and the N-domain senses increases in Ca(2+) concentration, is proposed.

Given the ubiquitous presence of CaM in all eukaryote cells, it is particular intriguing that carriers of either mutation show no additional symptoms. Here, we investigated the effects of the CaM CPVT mutations in a zebrafish animal model. Three-day-old embryos injected with either CaM mRNA showed no detectable pathologies or developmental abnormalities. However, embryos injected with CPVT CaM mRNA displayed increased heart rate compared to wild-type CaM mRNA under Î²-adrenergic stimulation, demonstrating a conserved dominant cardiac specific effect between zebrafish and human carriers of these mutations. Motivated by the highly similar physiological phenotypes, we compared the effects of the N53I and N97S mutations on the biophysical and functional properties of CaM. Surprisingly, the mutations have opposing effects on CaM C-lobe Ca(2+) binding affinity and kinetics, and changes to the CaM N-lobe Ca(2+) binding are minor and specific to the N53I mutation. Furthermore, both mutations induce differential perturbations to structure and stability towards unfolding.

The CALM1 gene is located on chromosome 2 and encodes for calmodulin 2, a 149 amino acid protein that is identical in sequence to two other calmodulin genes (CALM1 on chromosome 14 and CALM3 on chromosome 19). All three CALM genes have been classified as Definitive for Long QT syndrome by the LQTS Gene Curation Expert Panel, noting that these genes tend to be associated with atypical features of LQTS (presentation in infancy or early childhood and with heart block and severe QT prolongation). The CALM genes have also been associated with CPVT phenotypes although less evidence has thus far been published for CPVT compared to LQTS. Evidence for the association of CALM genes to CPVT comes from the International Calmodulin Registry study (Crotti et al, 2019, PMID:31170290) and other genetic and experimental studies. Genetic evidence for the association of CALM2 with CPVT comes from two apparently de novo cases with the p.Glu46Lys variant in the Registry (Crotti et al, 2019, PMID:31170290). Another de novo case was described with the p.Asn98Ser variant (JimÃ©nez-JÃ¡imez et al, 2016, PMID:27100291) - the same p.Asn98Ser variant was detected de novo in CALM1 in a CPVT patient (Nyegaard et al, 2012, PMID:23040497). A de novo case with the p.Asp132Glu variant was detected in a patient with mixed features of CPVT and LQTS and was therefore scored less than the default (Makita et al, 2014, PMID:24917665) - the same p.Asp132Glu variant was also detected de novo in CALM3 in a CPVT patient (Crotti et al, 2019, PMID:31170290). As the p.Asn98Ser variant was also observed in CALM1 in a CPVT case, the experimental evidence demonstrating a CPVT phenotype for this variant from zebrafish models (Sondergaard et al, 2015, PMID:25557436) and non-patient cellular assays (SÃ¸ndergaard et al, 2015, PMID:26309258) is also relevant for supporting the association of CALM2 with CPVT. Based on this genetic and experimental evidence, CALM2 scored with moderate evidence of association with CPVT. However, the expert panel unanimously agreed that, the despite this classification and the modest amount of published evidence linking CALM2 variants with a CPVT phenotype, all three CALM genes have unequivocal evidence for causation of isolated CPVT, in addition to LQTS and hybrid phenotypes. The three CALM genes encode for identical proteins which are all expressed in heart tissue, and multiple identical variants in two or more of the CALM genes have been shown to cause the same phenotypes, e.g. the de novo variant p.Asp130Gly has been shown in all 3 CALM genes to provoke LQTS in children, which demonstrates the functional similarity of these genes/proteins. Collectively, the three CALM genes would have strong/definitive evidence for association with CPVT. CALM2 has previously been classified as a definitive gene for atypical LQTS, unambiguously demonstrating the pathogenicity of this gene for inherited arrhythmia syndromes. Finally, as described above, multiple patients with CALM2 variants have been shown to present with a classical CPVT phenotype. Therefore this gene should be included in CPVT genetic testing panels. Note: All CPVT genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams was reviewed by the CPVT Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP). The classification and summary presented here is the conclusion of this GCEP's analysis according to evidence teams' efforts. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia Gene Curation Expert Panel on 20th January, 2021 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:42d280da-accc-46f2-8832-47d5a3eeeba7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
