The highest similarity of this cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequence is to human CA V (mitochondrial CA), hereafter referred to as CA VA. Recombinant protein expressed in COS-7 cells transfected with this cDNA clone was enriched in a mitochondrial fraction. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed cytoplasmic granular signals in COS-7 cells expressing a fusion protein of the novel CA and green fluorescent protein. Several lines of evidence suggest that the cDNA clone presented herein encodes a novel human mitochondrial CA isozyme, designated CA VB. CA VB has a hydrophobic N-terminal mitochondrial signal sequence (33 amino acid residues). Western blot analysis showed a 36-kDa protein precursor and a 32-kDa mature protein for CA VB. Similar to CA VA, CA VB is a \"low activity\" enzyme with a sensitivity to acetazolamide. The CA VB gene is located on Xp22.1. Northern blot analysis in normal human tissues demonstrated expression of a 1.3-kilobase transcript in heart and skeletal muscle, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed expression of CA VB in pancreas, kidney, salivary glands, and spinal cord but not in liver. CA VA mRNA expression was observed only in liver.

Subsequent studies identified two mitochondrial CAs. To distinguish the contribution of each enzyme, we studied the effects of targeted disruption of the murine CA genes, called Car5A and Car5B. The Car5A mutation had several deleterious consequences. Car5A null mice were smaller than wild-type littermates and bred poorly. However, on sodium-potassium citrate-supplemented water, they produced offspring in expected numbers. Their blood ammonia concentrations were markedly elevated, but their fasting blood sugars were normal. By contrast, Car5B null mice showed normal growth and normal blood ammonia levels. They too had normal fasting blood sugars. Car5A/B double-knockout (DKO) mice showed additional abnormalities. Impaired growth was more severe than for Car5A null mice. Hyperammonemia was even greater as well. Although fertile, DKO animals were produced in less-than-predicted numbers even when supplemented with sodium-potassium citrate in their drinking water. Survival after weaning was also reduced, especially for males. In addition, fasting blood glucose levels for DKO mice were significantly lower than for controls (153 ± 33 vs. 230 ± 24 mg/dL). The enhanced hyperammonemia and lower fasting blood sugar, which are both seen in the DKO mice, indicate that both Car5A and Car5B contribute to both ammonia detoxification (ureagenesis) and regulation of fasting blood sugar (gluconeogenesis). Car5A, which is expressed mainly in liver, clearly has the predominant role in ammonia detoxification.

CA5A was first associated with this disease in humans in 2014 (Karnebeek et al, PMID 24530203), and the association has been reported in 13 probands in 2 publications (Karnebeek et al, 2014, PMID 24530203; Diez-Fernandez et al, 2016, PMID 26913920). Six variants (including two missense, one nonsense, one splice site, one intronic deletion, and a single exon deletion) have been described in humans. Of note, deletion of exon 6 has been reported in six probands, all of whom are from the Indian subcontinent. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by the biochemical function of the gene product (carbonic anhydrase VA), and a mouse model (Shah et al, 2013, PMID 23589845). In summary, CA5A is definitively associated with autosomal recessive hyperammonemia due to carbonic anhydrase VA deficiency. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathies Expert Panel of the Inborn Errors of Metabolic Working Group on September 10th, 2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f7c5731a-866e-4a96-abb0-f0747f89280b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
