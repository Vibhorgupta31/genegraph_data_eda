A common glutamine-to-arginine change at codon 62 (Q62R) in its gene KLF11 has been recently associated with type 2 diabetes in two independent samples. Q62R and two other rare missense variants (A347S and T220M) were also shown to affect the function of KLF11 in vitro, and insulin levels were lower in carriers of the minor allele at Q62R. We therefore examined their impact on common type 2 diabetes in several family-based and case-control samples of northern-European ancestry, totaling 8,676 individuals. We did not detect the rare A347S and T220M variants in our samples. With respect to Q62R, despite >99% power to detect an association of the previously published magnitude, Q62R was not associated with type 2 diabetes (pooled odds ratio 0.97 [95% CI 0.88-1.08], P = 0.63). In a subset of normoglycemic individuals, we did not observe significant differences in various insulin traits according to genotype at KLF11 Q62R.

However, its functional role in the endocrine pancreas remains to be established. Here, we report, for the first time, to our knowledge, the characterization of KLF11 as a glucose-inducible regulator of the insulin gene. A combination of random oligonucleotide binding, EMSA, luciferase reporter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays shows that KLF11 binds to the insulin promoter and regulates its activity in beta cells. Genetic analysis of the KLF11 gene revealed two rare variants (Ala347Ser and Thr220Met) that segregate with diabetes in families with early-onset type 2 diabetes, and significantly impair its transcriptional activity. In addition, analysis of 1,696 type 2 diabetes mellitus and 1,776 normoglycemic subjects show a frequent polymorphic Gln62Arg variant that significantly associates with type 2 diabetes mellitus in North European populations (OR = 1.29, P = 0.00033). Moreover, this variant alters the corepressor mSin3A-binding activity of KLF11, impairs the activation of the insulin promoter and shows lower levels of insulin expression in pancreatic beta cells. In addition, subjects carrying the Gln62Arg allele show decreased plasma insulin after an oral glucose challenge. Interestingly, all three nonsynonymous KLF11 variants show increased repression of the catalase 1 promoter, suggesting a role in free radical clearance that may render beta cells more sensitive to oxidative stress. Thus, both functional and genetic analyses reveal that KLF11 plays a role in the regulation of pancreatic beta cell physiology, and its variants may contribute to the development of diabetes.","dc:creator":"Neve B","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Role of transcription factor KLF11 and its diabetes-associated gene variants in pancreatic beta cell function."},"rdfs:label":"KLF11

Furthermore, it has been reported that over-expression of KLF11 has a deleterious effect on insulin promoter activity. Thus, an altered expression level of KLF11 may contribute to the occurrence of type 2 diabetes. To investigate the contribution of KLF11 to type 2 diabetes in Japanese, we surveyed the 5' flanking region of KLF11 by reporter assay and identified the minimal promoter region of the gene. The promoter region from -250 to +162 bp including five Sp1 binding sites showed basal promoter activity both in MIN6-m9 and HepG2 cells. We also examined the entire region of KLF11 to detect genetic variants. A total of 19 polymorphisms, six of which are novel, were identified, but none of them showed association with the occurrence of type 2 diabetes. Two of the identified polymorphisms, R29Q and S124F, are novel coding variants. Functional analyses of these variants were performed, and similarly reduced effects on transcriptional activities of insulin, catalase1, and the Smad7 gene were found. We conclude that variants of KLF11 are not a major factor in the occurrence of type 2 diabetes in Japanese.

These regulatory elements, termed GC1 (human base pair -2061/-2055) and GC2 (-2036/-2027), are also nearly identical to the consensus KLF11 binding sequence defined here by random oligonucleotide binding analysis. KLF11 specifically associates with Area II in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, while preventing binding to GC1- and/or GC2-compromised Pdx1-driven reporter activity in beta cell lines. Mechanistically, we find that KLF11 interacts with the coactivator p300 via its zinc finger domain in vivo to mediate Pdx-1 activation. Together, our data identified a hierarchical regulatory cascade for these two MODY genes, suggesting that gene regulation in MODY is more complex than anticipated previously.

Alterations in KLF11 function result in maturity onset diabetes of the young 7 (MODY7) and neonatal diabetes; however, the mechanisms underlying the role of this protein in metabolic disorders remain unclear. Here, we investigated how the A347S genetic variant, present in MODY7 patients, modulates KLF11 transcriptional activity. A347S affects a previously identified transcriptional regulatory domain 3 (TRD3) for which co-regulators remain unknown. Structure-oriented sequence analyses described here predicted that the KLF11 TRD3 represents an evolutionarily conserved protein domain. Combined yeast two-hybrid and protein array experiments demonstrated that the TRD3 binds WD40, WWI, WWII, and SH3 domain-containing proteins. Using one of these proteins as a model, guanine nucleotide-binding protein β2 (Gβ2), we investigated the functional consequences of KLF11 coupling to a TRD3 binding partner. Combined immunoprecipitation and biomolecular fluorescence complementation assays confirmed that activation of three different metabolic G protein-coupled receptors (β-adrenergic, secretin, and cholecystokinin) induces translocation of Gβ2 to the nucleus where it directly binds KLF11 in a manner that is disrupted by the MODY7 A347S variant. Using genome-wide expression profiles, we identified metabolic gene networks impacted upon TRD3 disruption. Furthermore, A347S disrupted KLF11-mediated increases in basal insulin levels and promoter activity and blunted glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Thus, this study characterizes a novel protein/protein interaction domain disrupted in a KLF gene variant that associates to MODY7, contributing to our understanding of gene regulation events in complex metabolic diseases.","dc:creator":"Lomberk G","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Krüppel-like factor 11 regulates the expression of metabolic genes via an evolutionarily conserved protein interaction domain functionally disrupted in maturity onset diabetes of the young."},"rdfs:label":"Disruption of Interaction Domain"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The p.

Functional assays using ex vivo liver tissue sections demonstrate that Klf11-/- mice display increased insulin sensitivity. Genome-wide experiments validated by pathway-specific quantitative PCR arrays reveal that the Klf11-/- phenotype associates to alterations in the regulation of gene networks involved in lipid metabolism, in particular those regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. Combined, these results demonstrate that the major phenotype given by the whole-body deletion of Klf11 in mouse is not diabetes but increased insulin sensitivity, likely due to altered transcriptional regulation in target tissues. The absence of diabetes in the Klf11-/- mouse either indicates an interspecies difference for the role of this transcription factor in metabolic homeostasis between mouse and humans, or potentially highlights the fact that other molecular factors can compensate for its absence.

Summary of case-level and experimental data: 1.5 points. *KLF11 *was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes in 2005 (Neve et al., 2005, PMID: 15774581). One of the original variants reported, p.Thr220Met (rs34336420), is now known to have a MAF of 0.04 in Africans (gnomAD) and is classified as benign/likely benign in ClinVar, and the second one p.Ala347Ser (rs121912645) has MAFs of 0.0005 and 0.0001 in Latino and European populations respectively.  A common variant p.Gln62Arg (rs35927125, MAF in Europeans 0.12) was modestly associated with T2D in the original publication, but this is not borne out in the AMP T2D Portal (ExTexT2D exome chip Pval 0.08; type2diabetesgenetics.org).  A rare variant (p.His418Gln) in this gene segregated with antibody negative childhood onset diabetes in 3 family members; a fourth carrier was said to be unaffected with limited information available (PMID: 31124255), reducing evidence for segregation.  A rare variant (p.Pro193Thr) was found in a father and son with early onset (32 and 13 years) diabetes with metabolic syndrome features (PMID: 36241199).
