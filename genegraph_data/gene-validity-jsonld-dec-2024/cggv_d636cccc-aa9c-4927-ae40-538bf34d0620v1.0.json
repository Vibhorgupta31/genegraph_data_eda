σ1 subunit of the AP-1 clathrin-coated-vesicle adaptor-protein complex is expressed as three isoforms. Tissues express σ1A and one of the σ1B and σ1C isoforms. Brain is the tissue with the highest σ1A and σ1B expression. σ1B-deficiency leads to severe mental retardation, accumulation of early endosomes in synapses and fewer synaptic vesicles, whose recycling is slowed down. AP-1/σ1A and AP-1/σ1B regulate maturation of these early endosomes into multivesicular body late endosomes, thereby controlling synaptic vesicle protein transport into a degradative pathway. σ1A binds ArfGAP1, and with higher affinity brain-specific ArfGAP1, which bind Rabex-5. AP-1/σ1A-ArfGAP1-Rabex-5 complex formation leads to more endosomal Rabex-5 and enhanced, Rab5(GTP)-stimulated Vps34 PI3-kinase activity, which is essential for multivesicular body endosome formation. Formation of AP-1/σ1A-ArfGAP1-Rabex-5 complexes is prevented by σ1B binding of Rabex-5 and the amount of endosomal Rabex-5 is reduced. AP-1 complexes differentially regulate endosome maturation and coordinate protein recycling and degradation, revealing a novel molecular mechanism by which they regulate protein transport besides their established function in clathrin-coated-vesicle formation.","dc:creator":"Candiello E","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"AP-1/σ1A and AP-1/σ1B adaptor-proteins differentially regulate neuronal early endosome maturation via the Rab5/Vps34-pathway."},"rdfs:label":"Yeast Three Hybrid Analysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e144f2e3-cd4c-4350-bc7d-eaa12215e766","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:572b8667-8e90-4bbd-a8ef-42e01616c6e6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"AP-1 is a clathrin-associated complex that, in most cell types, mediates sorting between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (TGN).

Herein we show that somatodendritic sorting of various transmembrane receptors in rat hippocampal neurons is mediated by recognition of signals within the cytosolic domains of the proteins by the μ1A subunit of the adaptor protein-1 (AP-1) complex. This complex, in conjunction with clathrin, functions in the neuronal soma to exclude somatodendritic proteins from axonal transport carriers. Perturbation of this process affects dendritic spine morphology and decreases the number of synapses.

Of note, *AP1G1* has also been implicated in autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder (Usmani-Riazuddin syndrome, autosomal dominant). The split curation for Usmani-Riazuddin syndrome, autosomal dominant, is assessed separately.\n\n*AP1G1*-related autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder (also known as Usmani-Riazuddin syndrome, autosomal recessive) has been reported in three affected individuals from two unrelated consanguineous families carrying homozygous missense variants functionally characterized in cell culture and zebrafish models (PMID: 34102099). Common features in affected individuals included global developmental delay, hypotonia, speech delay, moderately to severely impaired intellectual development,  and spasticity. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. AP1G1 interacts with other  adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) proteins, AP1S1/AP1S2, which have been definitively implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. AP complexes mediate selective intracellular vesicular trafficking and polarized localization of somatodendritic proteins in neurons.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
