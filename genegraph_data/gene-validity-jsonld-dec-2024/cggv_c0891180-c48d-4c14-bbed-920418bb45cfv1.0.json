The 5-HT(1A)R is confined to the somatodendritic domain of central neurons, where it mediates serotonin-evoked hyperpolarization. Our previous studies underlined the role of the short 5-HT(1A)R C-terminal domain in receptor targeting to dendrites. We used this 17 aa region as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, and identified, for the first time, an intracellular protein interacting with the 5-HT(1A)R. This protein is homologous to the yeast Yif1p, previously implicated in vesicular trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, but not yet characterized in mammals. We confirmed 5-HT(1A)R-Yif1B interaction by glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments using rat brain extracts and transfected cell lines. Yif1B is highly expressed in the brain, and specifically in raphe 5-HT(1A)R-expressing neurons. Colocalization of Yif1B and 5-HT(1A)R was observed in small vesicles involved in transient intracellular trafficking. Last, inhibition of endogenous expression of Yif1B in primary neuron cultures by small interfering RNA specifically prevented the addressing of 5-HT(1A)R to distal portions of the dendrites, without affecting other receptors, such as sst2A, P2X(2), and 5-HT(3A) receptors. Together, our results provide strong evidence that Yif1B is a member of the ER/Golgi trafficking machinery, which plays a key role in specific targeting of 5-HT(1A)R to the neuronal dendrites. This finding opens up new pathways for the study of 5-HT(1A)R regulation by partner proteins and for the development of novel antidepressant drugs.","dc:creator":"Carrel D","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Targeting of the 5-HT1A serotonin receptor to neuronal dendrites is mediated by Yif1B."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in brain"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:c0891180-c48d-4c14-bbed-920418bb45cf_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a902df08-5570-4a01-ab6d-63337e9e0589","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8eb3a47a-5492-4380-843a-217e4d8238e7","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Knockdown of YIF1B in HeLa cells accelerated vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG) anterograde traffic without causing ER stress and without preventing its glycosylation process through the Golgi.

We found that Yif1B is not resident into the Golgi, but rather belongs to the IC compartment. After analyzing the role of Yif1B in protein transport, we showed that the traffic of the VSVG protein marker was accelerated in Yif1B depleted HeLa cells, as well as in hippocampal neurons from Yif1B KO mice. Conversely, Yif1B depletion in HeLa cells did not change the retrograde traffic of ShTx. Interestingly, in long term depletion of Yif1B as in Yif1B KO mice, we observed a disorganized Golgi architecture in CA1 pyramidal hippocampal neurons, which was confirmed by electron microscopy. However, because short term depletion of Yif1B did not change Golgi structure, it is likely that the implication of Yif1B in anterograde traffic does not rely on its role in structural organization of the Golgi apparatus, but rather on its shuttling between the ER, the IC and the Golgi compartments.","dc:creator":"Alterio J","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Yif1B Is Involved in the Anterograde Traffic Pathway and the Golgi Architecture."},"rdfs:label":"Alterio functional alteration in HeLa cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4297f91a-34f5-48f4-a558-24b65d432a83","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:508adc9b-17cd-42a1-9871-6f9815e63796","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Electron microscopy revealed that long-term depletion of Yif1b resulted in disorganized Golgi architecture in CA1 pyramidal hippocampal neurons.

Here, we report the clinical features of 10 patients from six independent families with mutations in the autosomal YIF1B gene encoding a ubiquitous protein involved in anterograde traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane, and in Golgi apparatus morphology. The patients displayed global developmental delay, motor delay, visual deficits with brain MRI evidence of ventricle enlargement, myelination alterations and cerebellar atrophy. A similar profile was observed in the Yif1b knockout (KO) mouse model developed to identify the cellular alterations involved in the clinical defects. In the CNS, mice lacking Yif1b displayed neuronal reduction, altered myelination of the motor cortex, cerebellar atrophy, enlargement of the ventricles, and subcellular alterations of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus compartments. Remarkably, although YIF1B was not detected in primary cilia, biallelic YIF1B mutations caused primary cilia abnormalities in skin fibroblasts from both patients and Yif1b-KO mice, and in ciliary architectural components in the Yif1b-KO brain. Consequently, our findings identify YIF1B as an essential gene in early post-natal development in human, and provide a new genetic target that should be tested in patients developing a neurodevelopmental delay during the first year of life. Thus, our work is the first description of a functional deficit linking Golgipathies and ciliopathies, diseases so far associated exclusively to mutations in genes coding for proteins expressed within the primary cilium or related ultrastructures. We therefore propose that these pathologies should be considered as belonging to a larger class of neurodevelopmental diseases depending on proteins involved in the trafficking of proteins towards specific cell membrane compartments.","dc:creator":"Diaz J","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"YIF1B mutations cause a post-natal neurodevelopmental syndrome associated with Golgi and primary cilium

syndrome (KABAMAS) is a recently identified severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe global developmental delay, epilepsy, movement disorder, epilepsy, and microcephaly. KABAMAS is caused by bi-allelic variants in the YIF1B gene which encodes a trafficking protein involved in the anterograde traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane including neural cells in association with other trafficking proteins and also Golgi apparatus morphology. That's why clinical overlapping between KABAMAS and golgipathies isn't surprising. It is a rare condition with only 24 patients reported to date. Here we described a 5.5-year-old boy presenting with severe global developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, microcephaly, dystonia, spasticity, blindness, feeding difficulties, respiratory failure, and dysmorphic features. Whole exome sequencing identified homozygous splice site variation (NM_001039672.3: c.297+1G > A) in the YIF1B gene. This splice site variant is rare in the general population (gnomAD Variant allele fraction (VAF): 0.0007%, 2 heterozygotes, 0 homozygotes) and has not previously been associated with the disease. Multiple in silico tools predict a deleterious effect of this splice site change. Considering the points mentioned above, we have considered the detected variant as pathogenic according to guidelines in light of current knowledge. By reporting a new case with the homozygous YIF1B splice site variant we provide further evidence to clinical and molecular data of this recently recognized severe neurodevelopmental disorder. We further emphasize that trafficking errors should be considered as an underlying mechanism in undiagnosed severe neurodevelopmental disorders.","dc:creator":"Sanri

It is associated with neurodegenerative diseases including leukodystrophy and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis diseases (NCLs), one of the most frequent childhood-onset neurodegenerative disorders. The current study focused on screening causative genes of developmental regression diseases comprising neurodegenerative disorders in Egyptian patients using next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based analyses as well as developing checklist to support clinicians who are not familiar with these diseases. A total of 763 Egyptian children (1 to 11 years), mainly diagnosed with developmental regression, seizures, or visual impairment, were studied using whole exome sequencing (WES). Among 763 Egyptian children, 726 cases were early clinically and molecularly diagnosed, including 482 cases that had pediatric stroke, congenital infection, and hepatic encephalopathy; meanwhile, 192 had clearly dysmorphic features, 31 showed central nervous system (CNS) malformation, 17 were diagnosed by leukodystrophy, 2 had ataxia telangiectasia, and 2 were diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis. The remained 37 out of 763 candidates were suspected with NCLs symptoms; however, 28 were confirmed to be NCLs patients, 1 was Kaya-Barakat-Masson syndrome, 1 was diagnosed as infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, and 7 cases required further molecular diagnosis. This study provided an NGS-based approach of the genetic causes of developmental regression and neurodegenerative diseases as it comprised different variants and de novo mutations with complex phenotypes of these diseases which in turn help in early diagnoses and counseling for affected families.","dc:creator":"Refeat MM","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"Whole exome screening of neurodevelopmental regression disorders in a cohort of Egyptian patients."}},"rdfs:label":"Refeat proband "},{"id":"cggv:7ebe2ac3-dd48-4312-a1a8-5c231cf76282","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7ebe2ac3-dd48-4312-a1a8-5c231cf76282_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.05,"dc:description":"Downgraded for homozygosity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2eefbc34-4481-49d5-8043-de2846107f6a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2eefbc34-4481-49d5-8043-de2846107f6a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":35,"allele":{"id":"cggv:70fcacf8-076e-4bd7-940e-0e92a3564ec0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001039672.3(YIF1B):c.367A>C (p.Lys123Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA405646413"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001347","obo:HP_0011968","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0001257","obo:HP_0000486","obo:HP_0001276","obo:HP_0001337","obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0032795","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0100704","obo:HP_0100543","obo:HP_0001762"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:0a89b428-b510-4835-9a30-3d7e23022762_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:70fcacf8-076e-4bd7-940e-0e92a3564ec0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33103737"},"rdfs:label":"Diaz Family 4 proband 4.1"},{"id":"cggv:0a89b428-b510-4835-9a30-3d7e23022762","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0a89b428-b510-4835-9a30-3d7e23022762_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:0a89b428-b510-4835-9a30-3d7e23022762_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Small amounts of YIF1B protein detected in patient fibroblasts compared to control"}],"strengthScore":0.05,"dc:description":"Downgraded 0.5 pt each for consanguinity and homozygosity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9125,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":16.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:bf72268f-ca3e-4b4c-9e79-7320f5076146","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0030878","gene":"hgnc:30511","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The *YIF1B* gene, located on chromosome 19 at 19q13.2, encodes a trafficking protein that belongs to the FinGER protein family and is involved in endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi trafficking. *YIF1B* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Kaya-Barakat-Masson syndrome (KABAMAS) in 2020 (Diaz et al. 2020, PMID: 33103737; AlMuhaizea et al. 2020, PMID: 32006098). KABAMAS is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by profoundly impaired global development with variable motor abnormalities, poor coordination resulting in the inability to sit or walk, impaired intellectual development with absent speech, poor eye contact, and feeding difficulties resulting in poor overall growth. More variable features include early-onset seizures, ocular anomalies, foot deformities, and nonspecific brain imaging findings. Dysmorphic features are generally not present. The disease generally presents at birth and may be lethal in infancy or childhood. The mechanism of disease is reported to be loss of function. At least ten unique variants (2 missense, 2 nonsense, 3 frameshift, 3 splice-site) that have been reported in 13 probands from four publications (PMIDs: 32006098, 33103737, 36435927, 36948290) are included in this curation. Most of the variants identified were homozygous occurrences in consanguineous families. More evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 34373908), but the maximum score allowed for genetic evidence has been reached (12 pts). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression data, functional alteration studies, and a *Yif1b* knockout mouse model (PMIDs: 18685031, 26077767, 32006098, 33103737). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *YIF1B* and autosomal recessive Kaya-Barakat-Masson syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic GCEP on the meeting date August 16th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c0891180-c48d-4c14-bbed-920418bb45cf"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
