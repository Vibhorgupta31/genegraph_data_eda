We applied Southern and Northern blot analyses and slot blotting of nuclear runoffs to delineate the process underlying aberrant PRPS1 expression in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts from patients with overactivity of normal PRS. Neither PRPS1 amplification nor altered stability or processing of PRS1 mRNA was identified, but PRPS1 transcription was increased relative to GAPDH (3- to 4-fold normal in fibroblasts; 1.9- to 2.4-fold in lymphoblasts) and PRPS2. Nearly coordinate relative increases in each process mediating transfer of genetic information from PRPS1 transcription to maximal PRS1 isoform expression in patient fibroblasts further supported the idea that accelerated PRPS1 transcription is the major aberration leading to PRS1 overexpression. In addition, modulated relative increases in PRS activities at suboptimal Pi concentration and in rates of PRPP and purine nucleotide synthesis in intact patient fibroblasts indicate that despite an intact allosteric mechanism of regulation of PRS activity, PRPS1 transcription is a major determinant of PRPP and purine synthesis.

We present the case of a 24-year-old Spanish woman with renal colic and hyperuricemia, which first manifested at age 11 years. Results of enzymatic and genetic studies supported the view that accelerated purine nucleotide and uric acid production in this woman resulted from defective allosteric regulation of PRS activity, which is, in turn, a consequence of a mutation in one of the patient's PRPS1 genes: an A-to-T substitution at nucleotide 578, encoding leucine for histidine at amino acid residue 192 of the mature PRS1 isoform. A previous example of disordered regulation of PRS1 activity in a family with a different substitution at the same amino acid residue strengthens this proposed mechanism. This is the first reported instance of PRS overactivity in which the propositus and sole affected family member is a woman.","dc:creator":"GarcÃ­a-PavÃ­a P","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase overactivity as a cause of uric acid overproduction in a young woman."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12847698","rdfs:label":"Garcia-Pavia_1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This woman was the first female proband to have overactivity of PRPS1 that caused increased uric acid production due to defective allosteric regulation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.75}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.75}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":102,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":5.75,"subject":{"id":"cggv:66176faa-b0ff-4fee-b695-c4a4f527dfa0","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010395","gene":"hgnc:9462","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The PRPS1 gene has been associated with X-linked phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 7/5/2018. This association was made using case-level and experimental data. At least 9 unique gain of function (GOF) missense variants have been reported in humans. The PRPP protein was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1972 (Sperling et al.); however, Roessler et al. first identified variants in the PRPS1 gene in 1993. Association is seen in at least 8 probands across 5 publications (PMID: 7593598, 28742244, 22246954, 8253776, 12847698). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member (PMID: 28742244). The crystal structure of this enzyme has been solved, which informs that functionally assessed GOF missense variants are located in one of two allosteric sites in the protein (Chen et al. 2015). This gene-disease association is supported by functional assays demonstrating that PRPS1 variants cause an overproduction of pyrimidines, leading to hyperuricemia and gout (PMID: 7593598, 28742244, 23509005). Of note, intellectual disability and developmental delay are present in the severe superactivity phenotype, which is usually observed in infants or young children; in contrast, the mild phenotype normally lacks these conditions and manifests in juvenile or adult probands (PMID: 22246954, 28742244). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms between GOF missense variants in PRPS1-superactivity and PRPS1 deficiency disorders (X-linked nonsyndromic hearing loss, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Arts syndrome, and more severe deficiency phenotypes), which are caused by loss of function missense variants. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. Although additional case-level information is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. These classifications were approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 7/9/2018. The ClinGen ID/Autism GCEP reviewed the curation on 12/11/2019 to include additional information about the incidence of intellectual disability in the disease spectrum.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:76dc3f8d-e1c9-4506-9381-d2b5ab3df300"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
