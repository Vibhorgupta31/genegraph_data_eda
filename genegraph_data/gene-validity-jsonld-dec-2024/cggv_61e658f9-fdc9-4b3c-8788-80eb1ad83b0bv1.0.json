Patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), an inherited deficiency in FECH, often show signs of iron deficiency in addition to phototoxicity which is caused by PPIX accumulation. However, iron supplementation often leads to exacerbation of phototoxicity. We report three EPP patients who had reduced erythrocytic PPIX concentrations when they were iron-deficient and their microcytic and hypochromic anemia deteriorated. Additionally, we found a significant increase in the amount of ALAS2 mRNA and protein among EPP patients. To verify the connection between FECH deficiency and ALAS2 over-expression, we inhibited FECH in cultured cells and found a subsequent increase in ALAS2 mRNA. We conclude that the primary deficiency in ferrochelatase leads to a secondary increase in ALAS2 expression. The combined action of these two enzymes within the heme biosynthetic pathway contributes to the accumulation of PPIX.

To identify possible mitochondrial factors that modulate ALAS-E function, we screened a human bone marrow cDNA library, using the mitochondrial form of human ALAS-E as a bait protein in the yeast 2-hybrid system. Our screening led to the isolation of the beta subunit of human ATP-specific succinyl CoA synthetase (SCS-betaA).

Mutations in the C-terminal region of human erythroid-specific ALAS (hALAS2) are associated with X-linked protoporphyria (XLPP), a disease characterized by extreme photosensitivity, with elevated blood concentrations of free protoporphyrin IX and zinc protoporphyrin. To investigate the molecular basis for this disease, recombinant hALAS2 and variants of the enzyme harboring the gain-of-function XLPP mutations were constructed, purified, and analyzed kinetically, spectroscopically, and thermodynamically. Enhanced activities of the XLPP variants resulted from increases in the rate at which the product 5-aminolevulinate (ALA) was released from the enzyme. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that the XLPP mutations altered the microenvironment of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor, which underwent further and specific alterations upon succinyl-CoA binding. Transient kinetic analyses of the variant-catalyzed reactions and protein fluorescence quenching upon binding of ALA to the XLPP variants demonstrated that the protein conformational transition step associated with product release was predominantly affected. Of relevance is the fact that XLPP could also be modeled in cell culture. We propose that (1) the XLPP mutations destabilize the succinyl-CoA-induced hALAS2 closed conformation and thus accelerate ALA release, (2) the extended C-terminus of wild-type mammalian ALAS2 provides a regulatory role that allows for allosteric modulation of activity, thereby controlling the rate of erythroid heme biosynthesis, and (3) this control is disrupted in XLPP, resulting in porphyrin accumulation.

Affected individuals frequently present in early childhood with severe cutaneous photosensitivity and accumulation of protoporphyrin within erythrocytes, often with an elevated proportion of zinc-protoporphyrin. Decreased iron stores and abnormal transferrin saturation are observed in some patients, as are hyperbilirubinemia, elevated liver enzymes, and other signs of liver disease. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, the molecular mechanism (gain-of-function) and mode of inheritance (X-linked dominant) were found to be distinct from patients with X-linked sideroblastic anemia 1, who instead harbor loss-of-function variants in *ALAS2* and exhibit a stronger male predominance among affected patients. The phenotypic differences between the two groups of cases appear to represent separate disease entities rather than a spectrum of disease. Therefore, cases caused by inherited *ALAS2* variants have been split into two separately-curated disease entities, referred to as X-linked erythropoietic protoporphyria (MONDO:0010420, MIM #300752), and X-linked sideroblastic anemia 1 (MONDO:0020721, MIM #300751).\n\nFive suspected pathogenic variants have been scored as part of this curation (three frameshift and two nonsense), which have been collectively reported in thirteen probands in three publications (PMID: 18760763, PMID: 23263862, PMID: 23364466). All thirteen probands were heterozygous for their respective variants. Segregation evidence was available in one of these publications (PMID: 18760763) and has contributed to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease relationship has not been studied in case-control studies at the single variant level or aggregate variant level.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be monoallelic gain-of-function, caused by frameshift or nonsense variants in the final exon (11) of *ALAS2* that trigger disruption of the C-terminal autoinhibitory loop (PMID: 23263862). All probands in this curation harbored one variant allele within the *ALAS2* locus.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence, as *ALAS2* encodes an enzyme responsible for synthesis of 5-aminolevulinic acid, a critical step in the protoporphyrin biosynthesis, heme biosynthesis, and cellular iron homeostasis pathways (PMID: 2347585, PMID: 26300302). *ALAS2* expression is highly restricted to blood cells (PMID: 23715323) and erythrocytes specifically (PMID: 2347585). Elevated *ALAS2* expression also occurs in the erythrocytes of patients with protoporphyria caused by loss-of-function variants in the *FECH* gene (PMID: 25179834). Finally, transgenic mice overexpressing Alas2 show related symptoms characterized as porphyria (PMID: 33785075).\n\nIn summary, *ALAS2* is definitively associated with X-linked erythropoietic protoporphyria. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 11th, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:61e658f9-fdc9-4b3c-8788-80eb1ad83b0b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
