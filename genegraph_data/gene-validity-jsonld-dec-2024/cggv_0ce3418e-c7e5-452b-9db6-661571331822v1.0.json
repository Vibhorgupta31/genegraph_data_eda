The NUP50 gene encodes nuclear pore glycoprotein p50, a nuclear pore complex component. The nuclear pore complex spans the nuclear envelope and allows the flow of molecules (proteins, RNA, carbohydrates, lipids and signaling molecules) between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Nuclear pore dysfunction precedes TDP-43 mislocalisation in neurons of sporadic ALS patients, and reciprocally is exacerbated by TDP-43 and FUS aggregation. \u000b\nA case-control rare variant burden analysis of whole-genome sequencing data identified a burden of 11 damaging variants in NUP50 among FTD/ALS cases compared to controls (PMID: 36670122).
