We report 16 new patients with MEF2C haploinsufficiency, including the oldest reported patient with MEF2C deletion at 5q14.3. We detail the neurobehavioral phenotype, epilepsy, and abnormal movements, and compare our subjects with those previously reported in the literature. We also investigate Mef2c expression in the developing mouse forebrain. A spectrum of neurofunctional deficits emerges, with hyperkinesis a consistent finding. Epilepsy varied from absent to severe, and included intractable myoclonic seizures and infantile spasms. Subjects with partial MEF2C deletion were statistically less likely to have epilepsy. Finally, we confirm that Mef2c is present both in dorsal primary neuroblasts and ventral gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA)ergic interneurons in the forebrain of the developing mouse. Given interactions with several key neurodevelopmental genes such as ARX, FMR1, MECP2, and TBR1, it appears that MEF2C plays a role in several developmental stages of both dorsal and ventral neuronal cell types.","dc:creator":"Paciorkowski AR","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"MEF2C Haploinsufficiency features consistent hyperkinesis, variable epilepsy, and has a role in dorsal and ventral neuronal developmental pathways."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23389741","rdfs:label":"LR11-310"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"No variant evidence to support the pathogenicity of the variation, or effect on MEF2C function.

Microdeletions within chromosomal bands 5q14.3q15 were recently identified as a recurrent cause of severe mental retardation, epilepsy, muscular hypotonia, and variable minor anomalies. By molecular karyotyping we identified two novel 2.4- and 1.5-Mb microdeletions of this region in patients with a similar phenotype. Both deletions contained the MEF2C gene, which is located proximally to the previously defined smallest region of overlap. Nevertheless, due to its known role in neurogenesis, we considered MEF2C as a phenocritical candidate gene for the 5q14.3q15 microdeletion phenotype. We therefore performed mutational analysis in 362 patients with severe mental retardation and found two truncating and two missense de novo mutations in MEF2C, establishing defects in this transcription factor as a novel relatively frequent autosomal dominant cause of severe mental retardation accounting for as much as 1.1% of patients. In these patients we found diminished MECP2 and CDKL5 expression in vivo, and transcriptional reporter assays indicated that MEF2C mutations diminish synergistic transactivation of E-box promoters including that of MECP2 and CDKL5. We therefore conclude that the phenotypic overlap of patients with MEF2C mutations and atypical Rett syndrome is due to the involvement of a common pathway.","dc:creator":"Zweier M","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutations in MEF2C from the 5q14.3q15 microdeletion syndrome region are a frequent cause of severe mental retardation and diminish MECP2 and CDKL5 expression."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20513142","rdfs:label":"Zweier Case 7"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Real time RT-PCR of MEF2C transcript(s) from patients blood show reduced expression levels of MEF2C transcript(s) (Figure 4).

The Mef2c cKO adult male mice prodiced 70% fewer USV calls in the presence of a sexually-receptive female than control littermates (Figure 5B). furthermore, the type of USC being produced by the Mef2C cKO mice varied significantly compared to wildtype littermates.

MEF2C is highly expressed in developing cortical excitatory neurons, but its role in their development remains unclear. We show here that conditional embryonic deletion of Mef2c in cortical and hippocampal excitatory neurons (Emx1-lineage) produces a dramatic reduction in cortical network activity in vivo, due in part to a dramatic increase in inhibitory and a decrease in excitatory synaptic transmission. In addition, we find that MEF2C regulates E/I synapse density predominantly as a cell-autonomous, transcriptional repressor. Analysis of differential gene expression in Mef2c mutant cortex identified a significant overlap with numerous synapse- and autism-linked genes, and the Mef2c mutant mice displayed numerous behaviors reminiscent of autism, ID and SCZ, suggesting that perturbing MEF2C function in neocortex can produce autistic- and ID-like behaviors in mice.","dc:creator":"Harrington AJ","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"MEF2C regulates cortical inhibitory and excitatory synapses and behaviors relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders."},"rdfs:label":"MEF2C Neocortical and hippocampal KO mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"This mouse model follows the molecular mechanism described in the humans with MEF2C variation (loss of function) and outlines several behavioral deficits that are consistent with learning and memory and social deficits.

At least 14 unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, small deletions, and large deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 14 cases, in 7 publications (PMIDs: 19592390, 20513142, 23001426, 23389741, 27255693, 28794905, 30376817). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism for disease appears to be de novo, loss of function. MEF2C is associated with the following disease entities per OMIM: (1) Chromosome 5q14.3 deletion syndrome (MIM:613443); and (2) Mental retardation, stereotypic movements, epilepsy, and/or cerebral malformations (MIM:613443). Note that these two disease entities share the same MIM number indicating they may be the same disease. However, per the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found that the Chromosome 5q14.3 deletion syndrome is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving multiple genes of interest beyond MEF2C, including the gene RASA1, exemplifying different molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, the Chromosome 5q14.3 deletion syndrome is associated with a skin phenotype that is not found in individuals with isolated variation in the MEF2C gene. Therefore, we have split into two disease entities; this curation represents the relationship between MEF2C and Complex Neurodevelopmental disorder (MONDO:0100038) (intellectual disability, stereotypic movements, epilepsy, and/or cerebral malformations phenotype) only, in accordance to assertions made in the literature (Paciorkowski et al., 2013 PMID:23389741). This gene-disease association is supported by biochemical function, expression studies, and animal models. In summary, MEF2C is DEFINITIVELY associated with autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Autism and Intellectual Disability Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 6, 2019 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:34354e8f-4343-4fba-82ba-e49579e504bb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
