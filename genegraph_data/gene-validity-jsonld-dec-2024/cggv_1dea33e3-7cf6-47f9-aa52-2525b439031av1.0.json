Transdermal rotigotine remarkably improved their gross motor functions and the asthenic status they complained. The present cases broaden the phenotypic spectrum of AADC deficiency and suggest that (1) AADC defect is not a progressive neurological disease and behaves rather as a neurodevelopmental disorder that improves during the second decade of life; (2) treatment-naïve adults can still respond well to neurotransmitter therapy; and (3) the possibility of a mild presentation of AADC deficiency should be considered when examining young adults with asthenic and parkinsonian symptoms.

Twenty-six patients without head control received bilateral intraputaminal infusions of a recombinant adeno-associated virus type 2 vector containing the human aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase gene (eladocagene exuparvovec) and have completed 1-year evaluations. Rapid improvements in motor and cognitive function occurred within 12 months after gene therapy and were sustained during follow-up for >5 years. An increase in dopamine production was demonstrated by positron emission tomography and neurotransmitter analysis. Patient symptoms (mood, sweating, temperature, and oculogyric crises), patient growth, and patient caretaker quality of life improved. Although improvements were observed in all treated participants, younger age was associated with greater improvement. There were no treatment-associated brain injuries, and most adverse events were related to underlying disease. Post-surgery complications such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage were managed with standard of care. Most patients experienced mild to moderate dyskinesia that resolved in a few months. These observations suggest that eladocagene exuparvovec treatment for aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency provides durable and meaningful benefits with a favorable safety profile.","dc:creator":"Tai CH","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Long-term efficacy and safety of eladocagene exuparvovec in patients with AADC deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Gene therapy in patients with AADC deficiency"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"A relatively large (n=26) number of patients treated by gene therapy, showing both clinical improvement and increase in dopamine (the product of the deficient enzyme, AADC)."},{"id":"cggv:f34184c0-4be2-4560-816d-ef935654defb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f5625dd2-edac-49f9-8a21-2bcda655cacf","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Mice with a knock in of a human pathogenic variant in Ddc, c.714+4A>T, exhibited symptoms similar to the clinical manifestations of human AADC deficiency, including hypokinesia, dyskinesia, autonomic dysfunction, and behavioral problems.

Children with AADC deficiency exhibit compromised development, particularly with regard to their motor functions. Currently, no animal model of AADC deficiency exists. We inserted an AADC gene mutation (IVS6+4A>T) and a neomycin-resistance gene into intron 6 of the mouse AADC (Ddc) gene. In the brains of homozygous knock-in (KI) mice (Ddc(IVS6/IVS6)), AADC mRNA lacked exon 6, and AADC activity was <0.3% of that in wild-type mice. Half of the KI mice were born alive but grew poorly and exhibited severe dyskinesia and hindlimb clasping after birth. Two-thirds of the live-born KI mice survived the weaning period, with subsequent improvements in their growth and motor functions; however, these mice still displayed cardiovascular dysfunction and behavioral problems due to serotonin deficiencies. The brain dopamine levels in the KI mice increased from 9.39% of the levels in wild-type mice at 2weeks of age to 37.86% of the levels in wild-type mice at 8weeks of age. Adult KI mice also exhibited an exaggerated response to apomorphine and an elevation of striatal c-Fos expression, suggesting post-synaptic adaptations. Therefore, we generated an AADC deficient mouse model, in which compensatory regulation allowed the mice to survive to adulthood. This mouse model will be useful both for developing gene therapies for AADC deficiency and for designing treatments for diseases associated with neurotransmitter deficiency.","dc:creator":"Lee NC","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Regulation of the dopaminergic system in a murine model of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse Ddc c.714+4A>T knock-in"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":4,"dc:description":"These mice were generated by knock in of a human variant in DDC that is known to cause AADC deficiency.

DDC encodes aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), also known as dopa decarboxylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation of L-Dopa to dopamine, and decarboxylation of L-5- hydroxytryptophan to serotonin (Montioli and Voltattorni, 2021; PMID 33808712). In patients with AADC deficiency, low levels of dopamine and serotonin results in symptoms such as movement disorder, developmental delay, hypotonia, oculogyric crises, and autonomic features.\n\nThe disease mechanism is loss of function. AADC deficiency was first reported in 1990 (Hyland and Clayton, PMID: 1700191) and the first report of biallelic variants in DDC in patients with AADC deficiency was published in 1998 (Chang, J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 21: 4, 1998). Since then, over 80 variants associated with AADC deficiency have been identified in over 120 patients (Montioli and Voltattorni, 2021; PMID 33808712). The relationship between DDC and AADC deficiency is supported by case-level and experimental evidence. Thirteen unique variants from ten probands in four publications were curated (Pons et al, 2004, PMID: 15079002; Tay et al, 2007, PMID: 17533144; Leuzzi et al, 2014, PMID: 24788355; Wen et al, 2020, PMID: 32409695). The most common variant, c.714+4A>T, a founder variant accounting for ~45% of AADC alleles in Taiwan and mainland China, is located in intron 6 and affects splicing (Lee et al, 2009, PMID: 18567514; Brun et al, 2010, PMID: 20505134; Tsai et al, 2018, PMID 30260058; Wen et al, 2019, PMID: 32409695). Further information is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the biochemical function of AADC, which is consistent with the biochemical and clinical findings in patients (Siaterli et al, 2003, PMID: 12718431; Montioli et al, 2021, PMID: 33808712), the biochemical and clinical features of a mouse with a knock-in human variant (Lee et al, 2013, PMID: 23275025), and the impact of gene therapy in human patients (Tai et al, 2022, PMID: 34763085). Additional experimental evidence is available in the literature but the maximum points for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. \n\nIn summary, DDC is definitively associated with AADC. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1dea33e3-7cf6-47f9-aa52-2525b439031a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
