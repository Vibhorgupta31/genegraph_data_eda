Her current visit was uneventful, her pregnancy progressing normally. Following the visit she went to a local restaurant where she suffered a cardiac arrest that was unresponsive to therapy. Chest compressions were continued from the time of her collapse until an emergency caesarian section was performed, delivering a healthy female infant. At autopsy a focal area of subtle pallor and myocardial thinning was present at the apex of the right ventricle. Histology showed myocyte degeneration and loss with focal full thickness replacement of myocardium by adipose tissue, consistent with the fatty form of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Molecular studies revealed a variant of unknown significance in the MYBPC3 gene, but no variant known to be associated with ARVC.

Screening of ARVC patient cohorts for MYBPC3 mutations has been performed in two studies (29709087, 27194543). In these studies, a total of 151 ARVC patients were investigated and three individuals were reported carrying MYBPC3 missense variants. However, the significance of these variants in the context of ARVC is unclear as they were either VUS (e.g. p.Arg238Cys) or MYBPC3 variant carriers were also double heterozygotes for variants in other genes associated with cardiomyopathies (29709087, 27194543). In one ARVC pedigree the identified MYBPC3 p.Phe305Profs variant did not segregate with ARVC in the family (28699631). A recent publication presented a single ARVC case with a missense variant (p.Glu1179Lys) in MYBPC3 (28843747). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. There is no clear evidence that the identified MYBPC3 variants contribute to the ARVC phenotype and there is no known disease mechanism that would link MYBPC3 with ARVC.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0639d989-8415-425c-ab89-e8a3a0b6ea49"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
