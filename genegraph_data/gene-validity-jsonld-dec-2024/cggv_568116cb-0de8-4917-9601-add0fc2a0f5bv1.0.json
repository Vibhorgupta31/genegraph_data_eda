Evidence exists for a perturbation of innate immunity as a primary pathogenic event in the disease phenotype. Here, we show that TREX1, encoding the major mammalian 3' --> 5' DNA exonuclease, is the AGS1 gene, and AGS-causing mutations result in abrogation of TREX1 enzyme activity. Similar loss of function in the Trex1(-/-) mouse leads to an inflammatory phenotype. Our findings suggest an unanticipated role for TREX1 in processing or clearing anomalous DNA structures, failure of which results in the triggering of an abnormal innate immune response.","dc:creator":"Crow YJ","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Mutations in the gene encoding the 3'-5' DNA exonuclease TREX1 cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome at the AGS1 locus."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:568116cb-0de8-4917-9601-add0fc2a0f5b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:568116cb-0de8-4917-9601-add0fc2a0f5b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f25df20d-1f79-43fa-b69c-36291920b470","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fdd0434a-940a-47f8-951b-0f4ce144a80a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Humans with biallelic TREX1 experience inflammation.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15254239","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"TREX1, originally designated DNase III, was isolated as a major nuclear DNA-specific 3'-->5' exonuclease that is widely distributed in both proliferating and nonproliferating mammalian tissues.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) isa chronic and heterogeneous autoimmune disease. Both twin and sibling studies indicate a strong genetic contribution to lupus, but in the majority of cases the pathogenic variant remains to be identified. The genetic contribution to disease is likely to be greatest in cases with early onset and severe phenotypes. Whole-exome sequencing now offers the possibility of identifying rare alleles responsible for disease in such cases. This study was undertaken to identify genetic causes of SLE using whole-exome sequencing.Methods. We performed whole-exome sequencing in a 4-year-old girl with early-onset SLE and conducted biochemical analysis of the putative defect.Results. Whole-exome sequencing in a 4-year-old girl with cerebral lupus identified a rare, homozygous mutation in the three prime repair exonuclease 1 gene(TREX1) that was predicted to be highly deleterious.The TREX1 R97H mutant protein had a 20-fold reduction in exonuclease activity and was associated with an elevated interferon-alpha signature in the patient.The discovery and characterization of a pathogenic TREX1 variant in our proband has therapeutic implications.The patient is now a candidate for therapy. Conclusion. Our study is the first to demonstrate that whole-exome sequencing can be used to identify rare or novel deleterious variants as genetic causes of SLE and, through a personalized approach, improve therapeutic options.","dc:creator":"Ellyard JI","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Identification of a pathogenic variant in TREX1 in early-onset cerebral systemic lupus erythematosus by Whole-exome sequencing."}},"rdfs:label":"Ellyard 2014 Case 1"},{"id":"cggv:4ffe7112-28d4-44c1-bc0d-00d566e1db9b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4ffe7112-28d4-44c1-bc0d-00d566e1db9b_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:4ffe7112-28d4-44c1-bc0d-00d566e1db9b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Quantification of the exonuclease activity revealed an approximately 20-fold reduction in exonuclease activity of TREX1R97H.

Other reports of TREX1 variants related to autosomal dominant disorders appeared in 2007 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Kirsch et al., PMID 17660816), in 2007 with retinal vasculopathy (Richards et al., PMID 17660820), and in 2015 with chilblain lupus (Rice et al., PMID 25703219). These conditions are considered to be forms of type 1 interferonopathy, which is defined as a condition in which increased type 1 interferon signaling leads to autoimmune and neurological disorders (MONDO:0700260). These disorders are caused by variants in genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism, sensing, and the innate immune response. Individuals with biallelic variants in TREX1 can present with a range of symptoms of variable severity and age of onset, within the context of an autoimmune disease. \nTREX1-related type 1 interferonopathy can result from biallelic or monoallelic variants in the TREX1 gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we identified differences in inheritance patterns that necessitate separate curation of autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive disease entities. In this curation, the autosomal recessive TREX1-related type 1 interferonopathy is treated as a distinct entity due to its specific inheritance pattern and clinical manifestations, separate from the autosomal dominant forms.\nThis curation of autosomal recessive TREX1-related type 1 interferonopathy included three missense, three frameshift, one nonsense, and one in-frame deletion variants reported in seven probands across three publications (PMIDs: 16845398, 31130681, 25138095). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by mouse models (PMID: 15254239). \nIn summary, definitive evidence supports the relationship between TREX1 and autosomal recessive TREX1-related type 1 interferonopathy, with rigorous and reproducible evidence in research and clinical diagnostic settings. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
