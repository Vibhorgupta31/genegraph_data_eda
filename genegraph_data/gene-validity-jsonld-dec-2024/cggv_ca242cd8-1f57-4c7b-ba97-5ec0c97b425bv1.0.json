Cutis laxa includes a family of clinically overlapping conditions with confusing nomenclature, generally requiring molecular analyses for definitive diagnosis. Six genes are currently known to mutate to yield one of these related conditions. We ascertained a cohort of typical ARCL2 patients from a subpopulation isolate within eastern Canada. Homozygosity mapping with high-density SNP genotyping excluded all six known genes, and instead identified a single homozygous region near the telomere of chromosome 17, shared identically by state by all genotyped affected individuals from the families. A putative pathogenic variant was identified by direct DNA sequencing of genes within the region. The single nucleotide change leads to a missense mutation adjacent to a splice junction in the gene encoding pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1). Bioinformatic analysis predicted a pathogenic effect of the variant on splice donor site function. Skipping of the associated exon was confirmed in RNA from blood lymphocytes of affected homozygotes and heterozygous mutation carriers. Exon skipping leads to deletion of the reductase functional domain-coding region and an obligatory downstream frameshift. PYCR1 plays a critical role in proline biosynthesis. Pathogenicity of the genetic variant in PYCR1 is likely, given that a similar clinical phenotype has been documented for mutation carriers of another proline biosynthetic enzyme, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase. Our results support a significant role for proline in normal development.","dc:creator":"Guernsey DL","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutation in pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 gene in families with cutis laxa type 2."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19576563","rdfs:label":"11807"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The homozygous missense variant Arg266Gln, at the last codon of exon 6, alters the canonical splice donor site. nested RT-PCR amplified spliced products confirmed skipping of exon 6 in patient mRNA.

Clinical data pointed out that homozygotic or heterozygotic mutation in the pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) gene in humans caused cutis laxa (ARCL) disease, with progeroid appearance, lax and wrinkled skin, joint laxity, osteopenia, and mental retardation phenotypes. In this study, we aimed to generate pycr1 knockout (KO) zebrafish and carried out biochemical characterizations and behavior analyses. Marked apoptosis and senescence were detected in pycr1 KO zebrafish, which started from embryos/larvae stage. Biochemical assays showed that adult pycr1 KO fish have significantly reduced proline and extracellular matrix contents, lowered energy, and diminished superoxide dismutase (SOD) and telomerase activity when compared to the wild type fish, which suggested the pycr1 KO fish may have dysfunction in mitochondria. The pycr1 KO fish were viable; however, displayed progeria-like phenotype from the 4 months old and reach 50% mortality around six months old. In adult stage, we found that pycr1 KO fish showed reduced locomotion activity, aggression, predator avoidance, social interaction interest, as well as dysregulated color preference and circadian rhythm. In summary, we have identified multiple behavioral alterations in a novel fish model for aging with pycr1 gene loss-of-function by behavioral tests. This animal model may not only provide a unique vertebrate model to screen potential anti-aging drugs in the future, but also be an excellent in vivo model towards a better understanding of the corresponding behavioral alterations that accompany aging.","dc:creator":"Liang ST","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Zebrafish Carrying pycr1 Gene Deficiency Display Aging and Multiple Behavioral Abnormalities."},"rdfs:label":"Zebrafish knockout"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This model is consistent with the progeroid symptoms in humans, such as growth delay, but does not fully recapitulate skin and bone defects observed in patients."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":865,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":17.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:20c45959-4033-4a13-b003-f99e1a43a048","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013051","gene":"hgnc:9721","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"PYCR1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive cutis laxa in 2009 (Guernsey DL, et al., 2009, PMID: 19576563; Reversade B, et al., 2009, PMID: 19648921). At least 40 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, etc.) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in the two initial publications. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in two additional family members (Guernsey DL, et al., 2009, PMID: 19576563). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the function of PYCR1 in proline metabolism, its expression in bone and skin, and animal models in Xenopus and Zebrafish with partial recapitulation of disease.
