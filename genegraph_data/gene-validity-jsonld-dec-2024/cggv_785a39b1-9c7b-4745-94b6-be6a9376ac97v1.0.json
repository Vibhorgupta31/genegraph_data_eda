Methods: We established the clinical and laboratory phenotype and genotype of six unrelated pedigrees comprising ten patients with clinical suspicion of HPS; including platelet aggregation, flow cytometry, platelet dense granule content, electron microscopy and high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Results: The clinical presentation showed significant heterogeneity and no clear phenotype-genotype correlations. HTS revealed two known and three novel disease-causing variants. The Spanish patients carried a homozygous p.Pro685Leufs17* deletion (n = 2) in HPS4, or the novel p.Arg822* homozygous variant (n = 1) in HPS3. In the case of two Turkish sisters, a novel missense homozygous HPS4 variant (p.Leu91Pro) was found. In two Portuguese families, genetic studies confirmed a previously reported nonsense variant (p.Gln103*) in DTNBP1 in three patients and a novel duplication (p.Leu22Argfs*33) in HPS6 in two unrelated patients. Conclusions: Our findings expand the mutational spectrum of HPS, which may help in investigating phenotype-genotype relationships and assist genetic counselling for affected individuals. This approach is a proof of principle that HTS can be considered and used in the first-line diagnosis of patients with biological and clinical manifestations suggestive of HPS. Key messages We established the relationships between the clinical and laboratory phenotype and genotype of six unrelated pedigrees comprising ten patients with clinical suspicion of HPS. Molecular analysis is useful in confirming the diagnosis and may offer some prognostic information that will aid in optimizing monitoring and surveillance for early detection of end-organ damage.

The phenotypes of these Sandy mice are consistent with the mimic nature of these mutations with regard to coat color, platelet dense granules, and lysosome secretion. Expression of dysbindin and Platelet serotonin levels are restored in sdy/sdy transgenic mice containing BAC54F9, which contains the entire Dtnbp1 genomic region. sdy/sdy progeny containing the BAC transgene had darker coats than sdy/sdy progeny lacking the transgene. These results confirmed that mutation of dysbindin causes the sdy phenotype and that dysbindin is important for normal platelet dense granule and melanosome biogenesis [PMID:12923531].","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1936982","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Sandy (sdy) is a mouse mutant with diluted pigmentation which recently arose in the DBA/2J strain. Genetic tests indicate it is caused by an autosomal recessive mutation on mouse Chromosome 13 near the cr and Xt genetic loci. This mutation is different genetically and hematologically from previously described mouse pigment mutations with storage pool deficiency (SPD). The sandy mutant has diluted pigmentation in both eyes and fur, is fully viable and has prolonged bleeding times. Platelet serotonin levels are extremely low although ATP dependent acidification activity of platelet organelles appears normal. Also, platelet dense granules are extremely reduced in number when analysed by electron microscopy of unfixed platelets. Platelets have abnormal uptake and flashing of the fluorescent dye mepacrine. Secretion of lysosomal enzymes from kidney and from thrombin-stimulated platelets is depressed 2- and 3-fold, and ceroid pigment is present in kidney. Sandy platelets have a reduced rate of aggregation induced by collagen. The sandy mutant has an unusually severe dense granule defect and thus may be an appropriate model for cases of human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome with similarly extreme types of SPD. It represents the tenth example of a mouse mutant with simultaneous defects in melanosomes, lysosomes and/or platelet dense granules.","dc:creator":"Swank RT","dc:date":"1991","dc:title":"Sandy: a new mouse model for platelet storage pool deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Sandy Mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The sandy mutant has an unusually severe simultaneous defect in melanosomes, lysosomes and/or platelet dense granules.

At least four unique variants (two nonsense and two frameshift variants)  have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least seven probands in five publications (PMIDs:  23364359, 28259707, 30990103, 31898847, 29345414). This gene-disease relationship is supported by its protein interactions with components of BLOC-1, which regulates trafficking to lysosome-related organelles [PMID: 12923531], the biochemical function that expressing no dysbindin protein had much fewer melanosomes in the retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid [PMID: 12923531], functional alteration in the patient cells showing the negligible of the DTNBP1 protein level [PMID: 28259707] and a mouse model with the disruption of DTNBP1 protein expression had a severe simultaneous defect in melanosomes, lysosomes and/or platelet dense granules which mimic human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and transgenic mice carrying the entire DTNBP1 genomic region could rescue the phenotypes in the mice [PMID:1936982]. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship and has been upheld over time.
