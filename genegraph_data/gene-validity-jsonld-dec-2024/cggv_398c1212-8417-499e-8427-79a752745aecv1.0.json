A combined disorder in the biosynthesis of N- and O-linked glycosylation with hyposialylation was detected. Western blot analysis showed a severe reduction in the COG5 and 7 subunits of the COG. A homozygous, intronic splice site mutation (c.169+4A>C) of the COG7 gene was identified in all patients. The phenotype is similar to that previously described in two patients of North African ethnicity with the same mutation, except for the lack of skeletal anomalies and only a mild liver involvement in our patients.

The COG complex interacts with core vesicle docking and fusion machinery at the Golgi; however, its exact mechanism of action is still an enigma. Previous studies of COG complex were limited to the use of CDGII (Congenital disorders of glycosylation type II)-COG patient fibroblasts, siRNA mediated knockdowns, or protein relocalization approaches. In this study we have used the CRISPR approach to generate HEK293T knock-out (KO) cell lines missing individual COG subunits. These cell lines were characterized for glycosylation and trafficking defects, cell proliferation rates, stability of COG subunits, localization of Golgi markers, changes in Golgi structure, and N-glycan profiling. We found that all KO cell lines were uniformly deficient in cis/medial-Golgi glycosylation and each had nearly abolished binding of Cholera toxin. In addition, all cell lines showed defects in Golgi morphology, retrograde trafficking and sorting, sialylation and fucosylation, but severities varied according to the affected subunit. Lobe A and Cog6 subunit KOs displayed a more severely distorted Golgi structure, while Cog2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 knock outs had the most hypo glycosylated form of Lamp2. These results led us to conclude that every subunit is essential for COG complex function in Golgi trafficking, though to varying extents. We believe that this study and further analyses of these cells will help further elucidate the roles of individual COG subunits and bring a greater understanding to the class of MTCs as a whole.","dc:creator":"Bailey Blackburn J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"COG Complex Complexities: Detailed Characterization of a Complete Set of HEK293T Cells Lacking Individual COG Subunits."},"rdfs:label":"Blackburn 2016_COG7 protein interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:398c1212-8417-499e-8427-79a752745aec_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aaa22466-2252-4459-9368-60f1f98a0e6a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:91839dce-4d6e-4613-886f-781221c2f611","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The Golgi structure is severely distorted in all knock outs compared to control.

PMID: 15107842). The COG complex is an evolutionarily conserved hetero-octameric protein tethering complex of the CATCHR (Complexes Associated with Tethering Containing Helical Rods) family, which controls several aspects of cellular homeostasis by orchestrating retrograde vesicle traffic within the Golgi. The COG complex interacts with all key players regulating intra-Golgi trafficking, namely SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive, factor-attachment protein receptor), SNARE-interacting proteins, Rabs, coiled-coil tethers, and vesicular coats. COG subunit deficiencies result in the accumulation of non-tethered COG-complex dependent (CCD) vesicles, dramatic morphological and functional abnormalities of the Golgi and endosomes, and severe defects in N- and O- glycosylation, Golgi retrograde trafficking, sorting and protein secretion. Defects in seven of the eight COG subunits have been linked to severe multi-systemic diseases known as COG Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (COG-CDG), a type II CDG (Climer et al. 2015. PMID: 26578865; Linders et al. 2020. PMID: 32629928; D'Souza et al. 2020. PMID: 32730773). COG7-CDG was discovered first (Wu et al. 2004. PMID: 15107842) and the patients may present facial structure abnormalities, winkled and loose skin, hypotonia, episodes of hyperthermia, hepatosplenomegaly, severe jaundice, recurrent infections, cardiac insufficiency, and epilepsy with the laboratory findings of CDG type II (Spaapen et al. 2005.

The score for genetic evidence is 10.4 pts. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. This includes the protein interaction of the COG7 subunit with other COG complex subunits in mammalian cells and destabilization of COG complex in HEK293T cell line lacking COG7, functional alteration in patient fibroblasts and HEK293T cell line lacking COG7, rescue of COG complex function after transfection of COG7 cDNA in patient fibroblasts and HEK293T cell line lacking COG7 (Ungar et al. 2002. PMID: 11980916; Wu et al. 2004. PMID: 15107842; Blackburn et al. 2016. PMID: 27066481). In addition, the non-human animal model of Drosophila with COG7 deficiency recapitulates the clinical and histopathological features of the disease in humans (Frappaolo et al. 2017. PMID: 28883096) (Experimental evidence – 6 points).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between COG7 and autosomal recessive COG7-CDG.
