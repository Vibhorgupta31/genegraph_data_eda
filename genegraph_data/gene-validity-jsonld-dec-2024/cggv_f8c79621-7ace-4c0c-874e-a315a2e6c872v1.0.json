Inheritance of a mutant RB allele in humans is responsible for bilateral retinoblastoma, a malignant tumor of the retina. Trilateral retinoblastoma (TRB) is a rare variant of familial retinoblastoma in which, in addition to retinal tumors, tumors develop from the pineal gland, an organ ontologically related to the retina. Germline inactivation of Rb in mice leads to mid-gestational lethality with defects in erythropoeisis and neurogenesis. This embryonic lethality prohibits the analysis of Rb function in selected cell types at later stages of development or in the adult. Here, we describe the Cre-LoxP mediated somatic inactivation of Rb in a subset of neuroendocrine cells, including photoreceptor cells. We observed neuroendocrine tumors of the pineal and pituitary gland. These tumors invariably showed inactivation of Rb and Trp53. Remarkably, loss of Rb in photoreceptor cells does not lead to retinoblastoma or any phenotypic changes, not even when photoreceptor cells are made deficient in Rb, p107 and Trp53. Our results highlight the important differences that exist in tumor susceptibility between mice and man (e.g pineal gland) and question the photoreceptor cell origin of human retinoblastoma.","dc:creator":"Vooijs M","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Tumor formation in mice with somatic inactivation of the retinoblastoma gene in interphotoreceptor retinol binding protein-expressing cells."},"rdfs:label":"IRBP-Cre: R1^-/- mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Score was reduced as retionoblastomas were not observed, but tumors of different origin.

Lesions predominantly arise in the brain and show features of neuroectodermal-like and glial-like tumors. Mutant allele analysis is consistent with tumor initiation due to somatic inactivation of rb1, revealing a conserved role for rb1 in tumor suppression across vertebrates. In contrast to genetic mosaics, heterozygous rb1-/+ adults show no evidence of neoplasia, while homozygous mutant rb1-/- are larval lethal. This is the first demonstration that somatic inactivation of a tumor suppressor causes cancer in zebrafish, and highlights the utility of site-specific nucleases to create genetic mosaic zebrafish for tumor suppressor gene discovery.

Hereditary retinoblastoma is caused by a germ-cell mutation, most often a new one, and thus there is usually no family history of the disease. Unlike patients with the nonhereditary disease, those with the hereditary form are at risk for additional retinoblastomas, and their progeny are at risk for the tumors. We used a sensitive technique of primer-directed enzymatic amplification, followed by DNA sequence analysis, to identify mutations as small as a single nucleotide change in tumors from seven patients with simplex retinoblastoma (with no family history of the disease). In four patients the mutation involved only the tumor cells, and in three it involved normal somatic cells as well as tumor cells but was not found in either parent; thus, these mutations appeared to be new, germ-cell mutations. In addition, we found point mutations in cells from a bladder carcinoma, a small-cell carcinoma of the lung, and another retinoblastoma.

It almost always presents in early childhood and is often bilateral. The retinoblastoma gene (RB1) was the first tumor suppressor gene identified based on location in the region of 13q14 germline deletion in some patients with retinoblastoma (PMID: 3480530). Oncogenic point mutations in RB1 were first reported by Yandell DW, et al., 1989 (PMID: 2594029). RB1 encodes a negative regulator of the cell cycle through its ability to bind the transcription factor E2F and repress transcription of genes required for S phase (PMID: 10647931). There is abundant evidence published associating the RB1 gene with retinoblastoma. Multiple case level studies (PMID: 2594029, 25928201) and a case control study (PMID: 28193182) have been performed with retinoblastoma patients that have variants in the RB1 gene. The variants include single amino acid changes, the whole gene deletion (about 3-5%) and nonsense or frameshift LOF variants. Many de novo variants were reported. A significant amount of case-level data is available, but the maximum points for genetic evidence has been reached (12 points). A zebrafish model of RB1 has been established to show development of retinoblastoma consistent with the disease phenotype. Tumor formation was observed when the IRBP-Cre:Rb1-/- mice were crossed with Tp53 mice to heterozygosity. In summary, RB1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant retinoblastoma. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f8c79621-7ace-4c0c-874e-a315a2e6c872"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
