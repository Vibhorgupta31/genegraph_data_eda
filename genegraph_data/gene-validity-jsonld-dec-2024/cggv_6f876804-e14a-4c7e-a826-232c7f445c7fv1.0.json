This is associated with a variety of ultrastructural defects of the cilia and sperm axoneme that affect movement, leading to clinical consequences on respiratory-tract mucociliary clearance and lung function, fertility, and left-right body-axis determination. We performed whole-genome SNP-based linkage analysis in seven consanguineous families with PCD and central-microtubular-pair abnormalities. This identified two loci, in two families with intermittent absence of the central-pair structure (chromosome 6p21.1, Zmax 6.7) and in five families with complete absence of the central pair (chromosome 6q22.1, Zmax 7.0). Mutations were subsequently identified in two positional candidate genes, RSPH9 on chromosome 6p21.1 and RSPH4A on chromosome 6q22.1. Haplotype analysis identified a common ancestral founder effect RSPH4A mutation present in UK-Pakistani pedigrees. Both RSPH9 and RSPH4A encode protein components of the axonemal radial spoke head. In situ hybridization of murine Rsph9 shows gene expression restricted to regions containing motile cilia. Investigation of the effect of knockdown or mutations of RSPH9 orthologs in zebrafish and Chlamydomonas indicate that radial spoke head proteins are important in maintaining normal movement in motile, \"9+2\"-structure cilia and flagella. This effect is rescued by reintroduction of gene expression for restoration of a normal beat pattern in zebrafish. Disturbance in function of these genes was not associated with defects in left-right axis determination in humans or zebrafish.","dc:creator":"Castleman VH","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutations in radial spoke head protein genes RSPH9 and RSPH4A cause primary ciliary dyskinesia with central-microtubular-pair abnormalities."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6f876804-e14a-4c7e-a826-232c7f445c7f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6f876804-e14a-4c7e-a826-232c7f445c7f_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:56345218-6f03-4381-bf32-58b0fbd543ae","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b8b95b0c-8a86-4917-8364-c6b1cf62f4fa","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23715323","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of loci for common diseases, but, for the majority of these, the mechanisms underlying disease susceptibility remain unknown.

Individuals with PCD caused by defective radial spoke (RS) heads are difficult to diagnose owing to lack of gross ultrastructural defects and absence of situs inversus. Thus far, most mutations identified in human radial spoke genes (RSPH) are loss-of-function mutations, and missense variants have been rarely described. We studied the consequences of different RSPH9, RSPH4A, and RSPH1 mutations on the assembly of the RS complex to improve diagnostics in PCD. We report 21 individuals with PCD (16 families) with biallelic mutations in RSPH9, RSPH4A, and RSPH1, including seven novel mutations comprising missense variants, and performed high-resolution immunofluorescence analysis of human respiratory cilia. Missense variants are frequent genetic defects in PCD with RS defects. Absence of RSPH4A due to mutations in RSPH4A results in deficient axonemal assembly of the RS head components RSPH1 and RSPH9. RSPH1 mutant cilia, lacking RSPH1, fail to assemble RSPH9, whereas RSPH9 mutations result in axonemal absence of RSPH9, but do not affect the assembly of the other head proteins, RSPH1 and RSPH4A. Interestingly, our results were identical in individuals carrying loss-of-function mutations, missense variants, or one amino acid deletion. Immunofluorescence analysis can improve diagnosis of PCD in patients with loss-of-function mutations as well as missense variants.

Motile cilia harbor a 9+2 arrangement consisting of nine doublet microtubules with dynein arms at the periphery and a pair of singlet microtubules at the center (central pair). In the central system, the radial spoke has a T-shaped architecture and regulates the motility and motion pattern of cilia. Recent cryoelectron tomography data reveal three types of radial spokes (RS1, RS2, and RS3) in the 96 nm axoneme repeat unit; however, the molecular composition of the third radial spoke, RS3 is unknown. In human pathology, it is well known mutation of the radial spoke head-related genes causes primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) including respiratory defect and infertility. Here, we describe the role of the primary ciliary dyskinesia protein Rsph4a in the mouse motile cilia. Cryoelectron tomography reveals that the mouse trachea cilia harbor three types of radial spoke as with the other vertebrates and that all triplet spoke heads are lacking in the trachea cilia of Rsph4a-deficient mice. Furthermore, observation of ciliary movement and immunofluorescence analysis indicates that Rsph4a contributes to the generation of the planar beating of motile cilia by building the distal architecture of radial spokes in the trachea, the ependymal tissues, and the oviduct. Although detailed mechanism of RSs assembly remains unknown, our results suggest Rsph4a is a generic component of radial spoke heads, and could explain the severe phenotype of human PCD patients with RSPH4A mutation.","dc:creator":"Yoke H","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Rsph4a is essential for the triplet radial spoke head assembly of the mouse motile cilia."},"rdfs:label":"mouse model - ciliary ultrastuctural and motility defects"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:980399e8-cbb5-4fa7-a203-62159af4e2d0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fe49dcd8-a563-430d-8b34-250ede27ed00","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"C. reinhardtii RSP4 and RSP6, which are homologs of each other, are equally closely related to human RSHL1 and RSPH4A.\nC. reinhardtii RSP4 has a 32% identity with “RSHL3”  RSPH4A.\nC. reinhardtii has a similar RS arrangement but lacks a full-length RS3, containing instead a shortened RS3 stump. \nMutating RSP4 results in a complete paralysis of Chlamydomonas flagella.\nThis suggests RSPH4A is important for normal movement of 9+2 motile cilia.\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16507594","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The radial spoke is a ubiquitous component of '9+2' cilia and flagella, and plays an essential role in the control of dynein arm activity by relaying signals from the central pair of microtubules to the arms.

Here, we use mass spectrometry to identify 10 additional radial spoke proteins. Many of the newly identified proteins in the spoke stalk are predicted to contain domains associated with signal transduction, including Ca2+-, AKAP- and nucleotide-binding domains. This suggests that the spoke stalk is both a scaffold for signaling molecules and itself a transducer of signals. Moreover, in addition to the recently described HSP40 family member, a second spoke stalk protein is predicted to be a molecular chaperone, implying that there is a sophisticated mechanism for the assembly of this large complex. Among the 18 spoke proteins identified to date, at least 12 have apparent homologs in humans, indicating that the radial spoke has been conserved throughout evolution.

The specific disease entity, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 11, is one of at least 50 different primary ciliary dyskinesias distinguished by a specific monogenetic cause. Affected patients frequently present as neonates or in early childhood with recurrent respiratory infections including sinusitis, as well as decreased nasal nitric oxide, otitis media, and/or bronchiectasis. Laterality defects were not observed for any of the reported patients. Biopsies of the airway epithelium ranged from exhibiting normal ciliary ultrastructure to central pair complex defects (PMID: 23798057, PMID: 25789548, PMID: 19200523). Ciliary motility is abnormal, characterized by a stiff ciliary appearance and beating, in some cases with a rotatory rather than planar pattern (PMID: 23798057, PMID: 25789548, PMID: 19200523). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism and mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) to be consistent among unrelated patients, while the phenotypic variability among them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited RSPH4A variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 11 (MONDO:0012978, OMIM #612649). Eleven suspected pathogenic variants were scored as part of this curation (five nonsense, two frameshift, two missense, and two splicing), which have been collectively reported in thirty-three probands (as well as affected family members) in three publications (PMID: 19200523, PMID: 23798057, PMID: 25789548). More case-level evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 23993197, PMID: 22448264, PMID: 24824133, PMID: 27637300, PMID: 25186273) but its inclusion in this curation was not necessary to reach the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points). This gene-disease relationship has not been studied in case-control studies at the single variant level or aggregate variant level. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function, characterized in some cases by the absence of a gene product (PMID: 33852348). All probands scored in this curation harbored two variant alleles within the RSPH4A locus.\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that human tissues exhibiting the highest levels of RSPH4A expression include tissue types relevant to disease and known to have motile cilia, including the lung, fallopian tube, brain, and testis (PMID: 23715323). More experimental evidence includes biochemical function as a core component of the radial spoke head, functional alterations in patient cells consistent with a critical role in motile cilia structure/function and altered expression in PCD patient tissue. Model organisms (Chlamydomonas and mouse) show ciliary ultrastructural and motility defects similar to those observed in patients (PMID: 25789548, PIMD: 16507594, PMID: 32203505, PMID: 32694165). Electron tomography can detect central complex defects and absence of RS1 and RS2 head proteins in motile cilia from patient respiratory epithelial cells, and absence of the three RS head proteins (RS1, RS2 and RS3) in KO mice (PMID: 33852348, PMID: 32203505). In summary, RSPH4A is definitively associated with autosomal recessive primary ciliary dyskinesia 11. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on March 10th, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6f876804-e14a-4c7e-a826-232c7f445c7f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
