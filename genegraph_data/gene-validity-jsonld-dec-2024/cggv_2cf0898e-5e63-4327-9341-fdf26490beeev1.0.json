Hair bundles of mutant mice defective for either protein have abnormally short stereocilia. Here, we show that whirlin, like myosin XVa, is present at the very tip of each stereocilium in the developing and mature hair bundles of the cochlear and vestibular system. We found that myosin XVa SH3-MyTH4 region binds to the short isoform of whirlin (PR-PDZ3) that can rescue the stereocilia growth defect in whirlin defective mice. Moreover, the C-terminal MyTH4-FERM region of myosin XVa binds to the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of the long whirlin isoform. We conclude that a direct myosin XVa-whirlin interaction at the stereocilia tip is likely to control the elongation of stereocilia. Whirlin, unlike myosin XVa, is also transiently localized in the basal region of developing stereocilia in rat vestibular and cochlear hair cells until P4 and P12, respectively. Notably, whirlin also interacts with myosin VIIa that is present along the entire length of the stereocilia. Finally, we show that the transmembrane netrin-G1 ligand (NGL-1) binds to the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of whirlin and has an extracellular region that homophilically self-interacts in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The interaction between whirlin and NGL-1 might be involved in the stabilization of interstereociliar links.","dc:creator":"Delprat B","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Myosin XVa and whirlin, two deafness gene products required for hair bundle growth, are located at the stereocilia tips and interact directly."},"rdfs:label":"Delprat Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Approved at 1 point"},{"id":"cggv:891b8a32-2e44-4bf0-8996-63d73877168d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c48a9c0b-ad95-4676-82b5-4fe7979a2510","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"C-terminal PDZ ligand of mouse MYO15A interacts with PDZ domain of WHRN","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15654330","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Stereocilia are microvilli-derived mechanosensory organelles that are arranged in rows of graded heights on the apical surface of inner-ear hair cells.

Abnormally short stereocilia bundles that have a diminished staircase are characteristic of the shaker 2 (Myo15a(sh2)) and whirler (Whrn(wi)) strains of deaf mice. We show that myosin-XVa is a motor protein that, in vivo, interacts with the third PDZ domain of whirlin through its carboxy-terminal PDZ-ligand. Myosin-XVa then delivers whirlin to the tips of stereocilia. Moreover, if green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Myo15a is transfected into hair cells of Myo15a(sh2) mice, the wild-type pattern of hair bundles is restored by recruitment of endogenous whirlin to the tips of stereocilia.

The shaker 2 allele is a previously described missense mutation of a highly conserved residue in the motor domain of myosin XV. The shaker 2(J) lesion, in contrast, is a 14.7 kb deletion that removes the last six exons from the 3\"-terminus of the Myo15 transcript. These exons encode a FERM (F, ezrin, radixin and moesin) domain that may interact with integral membrane proteins. Despite the deletion of six exons, Myo15 mRNA transcripts and protein are present in the post-natal day 1 shaker 2(J) inner ear, which suggests that the FERM domain is critical for the development of normal hearing and balance. Myo15 transcripts are first detectable at embryonic day 13.5 in wild-type mice. Myo15 transcripts in the mouse inner ear are restricted to the sensory epithelium of the developing cristae ampularis, macula utriculi and macula sacculi of the vestibular system as well as to the developing organ of Corti. Both the shaker 2 and shaker 2(J) alleles result in abnormally short hair cell stereocilia in the cochlear and vestibular systems.

In this study, we have adopted a new flexible approach using microdroplet PCR-based technology for target enrichment, in combination with massive parallel sequencing to develop a DNA diagnostic test for autosomal recessive hereditary hearing loss. This approach enabled us to identify the genetic basis of hearing loss in 9 of 24 patients, a success rate of 37.5%. Our method also proved to have high sensitivity and specificity. Currently, routine molecular genetic diagnostic testing for deafness is in most cases only performed for the GJB2 gene and a positive result is typically only obtained in 10-20% of deaf children. Individuals with mutations in GJB2 had already been excluded in our selected set of 24 patients. Therefore, we anticipate that our deafness test may lead to a genetic diagnosis in roughly 50% of unscreened autosomal recessive deafness cases.

This association was made using case-level data. Twelve variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift and splice-site) were scored for this curation. MYO15A was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1998 (Wang et al.​). Association is seen in at least 12 probands in 4 publications (27375115, 26226137, 23208854, 19309289), however much more evidence is available in the literature. The maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached. Rehman et al. 2016 provides a summary of available published MYO15A variants (27375115). This gene-disease association is supported by two mouse models and a mouse rescue (9603735, 10915760). In summary, MYO15A is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 11/21/17.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2cf0898e-5e63-4327-9341-fdf26490beee"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
