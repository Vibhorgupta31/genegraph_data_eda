Nuclear-encoded gene products are essential for all processes within the organelle, including RNA processing. Transcription of the mitochondrial genome generates large polycistronic transcripts punctuated by the 22 mitochondrial (mt) tRNAs that are conventionally cleaved by the RNase P-complex and the RNase Z activity of ELAC2 at 5' and 3' ends, respectively. We report the identification of mutations in ELAC2 in five individuals with infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and complex I deficiency. We observed accumulated mtRNA precursors in affected individuals muscle and fibroblasts. Although mature mt-tRNA, mt-mRNA, and mt-rRNA levels were not decreased in fibroblasts, the processing defect was associated with impaired mitochondrial translation. Complementation experiments in mutant cell lines restored RNA processing and a yeast model provided additional evidence for the disease-causal role of defective ELAC2, thereby linking mtRNA processing to human disease.","dc:creator":"Haack TB","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"ELAC2 mutations cause a mitochondrial RNA processing defect associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ff57f761-51cd-41aa-a287-7387e0f5f028_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ff57f761-51cd-41aa-a287-7387e0f5f028_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:391a85e6-a96a-4d56-9aa6-7f3c78c13b15","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:332205a4-b8de-4b33-a997-a891f28573a5","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"This protein is critical for mtRNA expression and processing and is essential for tRNA maturation.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21593607","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Accurate tRNA processing is crucial for human mitochondrial genome expression, but the mechanisms of mt-tRNA cleavage and the key enzymes involved in this process are poorly characterized. At least two activities are required for proper mt-tRNA maturation: RNase P cleaving precursor molecules at the 5' end and tRNase Z at the 3' end. In human mitochondria only RNase P has been identified so far. Using RT-PCR and northern blot analyses we found that silencing of the human ELAC2 gene results in impaired 3' end of mt-tRNAs. We demonstrate this for several mitochondrial tRNAs, encoded on both mtDNA strands, including tRNA (Val) , tRNA (Lys) , tRNA (Arg) , tRNA (Gly) , tRNA (Leu(UUR)) and tRNA (Glu) . The silencing of the MRPP1 gene that encodes a subunit of mtRNase P resulted in inhibition of both 5' and 3' processing. We also demonstrate the double mitochondrial/nuclear localization of the ELAC2 protein using immunofluorescence.

It encodes Zinc phosphodiesterase ELAC protein 2 (ELAC2), which plays an essential role in the production of mature tRNAs. To establish a causal connection between ELAC2 variants and CM, here we used the Drosophila melanogaster model organism, which carries the ELAC2 homolog RNaseZ. Even though RNaseZ and ELAC2 have diverged in some of their biological functions, our study demonstrates the use of the fly model to study the mechanism of ELAC2-related pathology. We established transgenic lines harboring RNaseZ with CM-linked mutations in the background of endogenous RNaseZ knockout. Importantly, we found that the phenotype of these flies is consistent with the pathological features in human patients. Specifically, expression of CM-linked variants in flies caused heart hypertrophy and led to reduction in cardiac contractility associated with a rare form of CM. This study provides first experimental evidence for the pathogenicity of CM-causing mutations in the ELAC2 protein, and the foundation to improve our understanding and diagnosis of this rare infantile disease.

All RNase Z proteins tested so far were found to possess endoribonuclease activity, which is responsible for the removal of a 3' trailer from a primary tRNA transcript. Given that tRNA 3'-end processing has been delineated using in vitro, bacterial and cell culture models, its relevance to RNase Z functions in vivo has yet to be established. In this study, we employed heritable RNA interference (RNAi) in combination with the GAL4/UAS system to spatiotemporally knockdown the dRNaseZ gene and study its biological role in cells of a developing fruit fly. We found that dRNaseZ is an essential gene, as ubiquitous knockdown caused growth arrest and early larval lethality. Molecular analysis confirmed that dRNaseZ is necessary for 3'-end processing of nuclear and mitochondrial tRNAs: knockdown larvae displayed significant accumulation of both types of processing intermediates with extensions at the 3' end. This is the first in vivo demonstration of RNase Z(L) dependent tRNA processing in the context of a metazoan model organism. Using tissue-specific GAL4 drivers, we also showed that in mitotically growing imaginal discs dRNaseZ is required for cell proliferation and/or viability, but not for the maintenance of their differentiated progeny. In endoreplicating salivary glands, dRNaseZ controls organ size by supporting cell growth but not DNA replication. Although the mechanisms remain unclear, our results support the notion that RNase Z(L) is involved in biological pathways regulating cell growth and proliferation.","dc:creator":"Xie X","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"RNAi knockdown of dRNaseZ, the Drosophila homolog of ELAC2, impairs growth of mitotic and endoreplicating tissues."},"rdfs:label":"Xie_drosophila"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Recapitulation of phenotype."},{"id":"cggv:88833ac5-6302-4a94-9ec8-ad4e833e2488","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:619db185-1eb1-4ff7-b198-02b4fce497c5","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The KO offspring had reduced body weight, significant weight loss (Fig. 1B), cardiomyopathy (Fig. 1C, E), and a shortened life span (death at ~4 weeks, data not shown).

Finally, we show that primary fibroblasts from the affected individuals have elevated levels of unprocessed mitochondrial RNA precursors. Our study thus broadly confirms the correlation of ELAC2 variants with severe infantile-onset forms of HCM and mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction.

The *ELAC2* gene encodes the elaC ribonuclease Z 2 that is involved in mitochondrial RNA expression and processing, and is essential for tRNA maturation. \n\nThe *ELAC2* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2013 (PMID: 23849775). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *ELAC2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *ELAC2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to per the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 15 variants (one nonsense, 11 missense, 3 splice site) from 10 individuals from two publications (PMIDs: 23849775, 31045291). More cases are reported in the medical literature but not included in this curation as the maximum case level score was reached. Affected individuals are variably affected and clinical features include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, intrauterine growth restriction, developmental delay, hypotonia, muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, microcephaly, feeding difficulty, sensorineural hearing loss, and lactic acidosis. Muscle biopsies show mitochondria with increased size and abnormal cristae, ragged red fibers, COX-negative fibers, and variable respiratory chain enzyme complex deficiencies. A heart transplant was successful in at least one individual (PMID: 31045291). \n\nLoss of function is the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, and model systems in mice and *Drosophila melanogaster* (PMIDs: 21593607, 23849775, 21146608, 34338278, 30126926).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 21, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ff57f761-51cd-41aa-a287-7387e0f5f028"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
