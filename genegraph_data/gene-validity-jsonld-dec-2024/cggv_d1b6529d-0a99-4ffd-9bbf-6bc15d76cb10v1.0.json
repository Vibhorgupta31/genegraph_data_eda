Recently, we have shown that the inheritance of the common hypomorphic IVS3-48C allele trans to a deleterious mutation reduces FECH activity to below a critical threshold and accounts for the photosensitivity seen in patients. Rare cases of autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported. We studied a cohort of 173 white French EPP families and a group of 360 unrelated healthy subjects from four ethnic groups. The prevalences of the recessive and dominant autosomal forms of EPP are 4% (95% confidence interval 1-8) and 95% (95% confidence interval 91-99), respectively. In 97.9% of dominant cases, an IVS3-48C allele is co-inherited with the deleterious mutation. The frequency of the IVS3-48C allele differs widely in the Japanese (43%), southeast Asian (31%), white French (11%), North African (2.7%), and black West African (<1%) populations. These differences can be related to the prevalence of EPP in these populations and could account for the absence of EPP in black subjects. The phylogenic origin of the IVS3-48C haplotypes strongly suggests that the IVS3-48C allele arose from a single recent mutational event. Estimation of the age of the IVS3-48C allele from haplotype data in white and Asian populations yields an estimated age three to four times younger in the Japanese than in the white population, and this difference may be attributable either to differing demographic histories or to positive selection for the IVS3-48C allele in the Asian population. Finally, by calculating the KA/KS ratio in humans and chimpanzees, we show that the FECH protein sequence is subject to strong negative pressure. Overall, EPP looks like a Mendelian disorder, in which the prevalence of overt disease depends mainly on the frequency of a single common single-nucleotide polymorphism resulting from a unique mutational event that occurred 60,000 years ago.","dc:creator":"Gouya L","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Contribution of a common single-nucleotide polymorphism to the genetic predisposition for erythropoietic protoporphyria."}},{"id":"cggv:b3f6d975-cfcd-40e6-9fde-f4ba4e8a7921_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2b579fe4-c53e-4ba6-a5d4-463aba85d786"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16385445"}],"rdfs:label":"Gouya2005_P2"},{"id":"cggv:b3f6d975-cfcd-40e6-9fde-f4ba4e8a7921","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b3f6d975-cfcd-40e6-9fde-f4ba4e8a7921_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b3f6d975-cfcd-40e6-9fde-f4ba4e8a7921_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"To examine the impact of the mutations on FECH activity, seven new point mutations (I71K, S151P, Y191H, P192T, T283I, M288K, and P334L), as well as the 3-bp in-frame deletion CTT1248–1250, were expressed in a bacterial system.

EPP is normally inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with low clinical penetrance; the many different mutations that have been identified are restricted to one FECH allele, with the other one being free of any mutations. However, clinical manifestations of dominant EPP cannot be simply a matter of FECH haploinsufficiency, because patients have enzyme levels that are lower than the expected 50%. From RNA analysis in one family with dominant EPP, we recently suggested that clinical expression required coinheritance of a normal FECH allele with low expression and a mutant FECH allele. We now show that (1) coinheritance of a FECH gene defect and a wild-type low-expressed allele is generally involved in the clinical expression of EPP; (2) the low-expressed allelic variant was strongly associated with a partial 5' haplotype [-251G IVS1-23T IVS2microsatA9] that may be ancestral and was present in an estimated 10% of a control group of Caucasian origin; and (3) haplotyping allows the absolute risk of developing the disease to be predicted for those inheriting FECH EPP mutations. EPP may thus be considered as an inherited disorder that does not strictly follow recessive or dominant rules. It may represent a model for phenotype modulation by mild variation in expression of the wild-type allele in autosomal dominant diseases.","dc:creator":"Gouya L","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Inheritance in erythropoietic protoporphyria: a common wild-type ferrochelatase allelic variant with low expression accounts for clinical manifestation."}},{"id":"cggv:f54669d9-233d-4447-ae6d-b6d2d6760871_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d68a35ff-c717-4f95-a83c-29ecce06b017"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10068685"}],"rdfs:label":"II-4-1"},{"id":"cggv:f54669d9-233d-4447-ae6d-b6d2d6760871","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f54669d9-233d-4447-ae6d-b6d2d6760871_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:f54669d9-233d-4447-ae6d-b6d2d6760871_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The IVS3–48T/C transition modulates the splicing efficiency of a constitutive cryptic acceptor splice site.

Development of clinically overt EPP usually requires inheritance of a severe FECH mutation trans to a low-expression FECH variant (FECH IVS3-48C), which is present in 13% of the U.K. population. Reduced FECH activity leads to accumulation of protoporphyrin in various tissues. An excess amount of free protoporphyrin in the skin causes photosensitivity. EPP usually presents in early childhood or infancy, with painful burning and pruritus within minutes of light exposure. Onset of symptoms in adults is rare and often associated with acquired somatic mutation of the FECH gene secondary to haematological malignancy. Here we describe a patient with EPP, in whom the presenting clinical symptom, night-time itch, did not appear until middle age and who had an asymptomatic sister with the same FECH genotype.","dc:creator":"Berroeta L","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Late presentation of erythropoietic protoporphyria: case report and genetic analysis of family members."}},{"id":"cggv:b846f2c0-0c5b-410f-a225-8cb8841f1351_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1ca00599-3699-46e2-85c9-15a0f63815c2"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17711525"}],"rdfs:label":"Berroeta2007_49yrold_female"},{"id":"cggv:b846f2c0-0c5b-410f-a225-8cb8841f1351","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b846f2c0-0c5b-410f-a225-8cb8841f1351_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:9822a83b-4dff-49d2-8a1f-5b9263ae6cfb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9822a83b-4dff-49d2-8a1f-5b9263ae6cfb_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:9822a83b-4dff-49d2-8a1f-5b9263ae6cfb_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"This is the common variant."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ecdeb5f2-e02e-474a-b1a2-59c4be2ed0d3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ecdeb5f2-e02e-474a-b1a2-59c4be2ed0d3","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:125e2ae8-85e4-48c6-8e6f-2749fa246011","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000018.10:g.57551315del (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2573131668"}},{"id":"cggv:d68a35ff-c717-4f95-a83c-29ecce06b017"}],"detectionMethod":"In families 2 through 5, the specific FECH gene mutations were characterized by direct sequencing of FECH cDNA and further confirmed at the genomic DNA level.

Due to the many critical roles of heme, synthesis of heme is required by the vast majority of organisms. Despite significant investigation of both the microbial and eukaryotic enzyme, details of metal chelation remain unidentified. Here we present the first structure of the wild-type human enzyme, a lead-inhibited intermediate of the wild-type enzyme with bound metallated porphyrin macrocycle, the product bound form of the enzyme, and a higher resolution model for the substrate-bound form of the E343K variant. These data paint a picture of an enzyme that undergoes significant changes in secondary structure during the catalytic cycle. The role that these structural alterations play in overall catalysis and potential protein-protein interactions with other proteins, as well as the possible molecular basis for these changes, is discussed. The atomic details and structural rearrangements presented herein significantly advance our understanding of the substrate binding mode of ferrochelatase and reveal new conformational changes in a structurally conserved pi-helix that is predicted to have a central role in product release.","dc:creator":"Medlock AE","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"A pi-helix switch selective for porphyrin deprotonation and product release in human ferrochelatase."},"rdfs:label":"Crystal structure of FECH"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:50af4c19-10d8-4474-877e-f74dcb2a6b54","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:82c2e546-13cb-48c7-aa90-0e547d47ffbf","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Protoporphyrin accumulates causing photosensitivity and other problems.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16385445","rdfs:label":"FECH enzyme activity assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:d1b6529d-0a99-4ffd-9bbf-6bc15d76cb10_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:625d9862-e23f-4081-bacb-512d0f12ded0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5a61de8d-9b7a-4f34-b759-dc6f76a2b503","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Skin photosensitivity is the main clinical symptom of patients suffering from EPP.

Ferrochelatase catalyzes the eighth and final step in heme biosynthesis incorporating iron into the protoporphyrin ring. The disease was initially mischaracterized with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (PMID: 1755842). This is because the classical clinical presentation is a loss-of-function mutation in trans with an intronic hypomorphic allele IVS3-48T>C (this variant has a frequency as high as 34% in the Latino/admixed American populations). This intronic variant was initially ignored because it was common resulting in the disease being mischaracterized with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. However, this common allele should not be overlooked as it causes aberrant splicing of exon 3 resulting in an additional 63 base pairs to exon 3 which causes nonsense mediated decay of the transcript. Combined with a null allele in trans, the common IVS3-48T>C variant causes enzyme levels to drop below 35%. Below this level, clinical symptoms of acute cutaneous photosensitivity to sunlight begin to appear. The lower the functional enzyme concentration, typically the more severe disease (cases with two LOF alleles in trans report severe disease often with liver complications). Symptoms of phototoxicity and hepatoxicity are caused by protoporphyrin accumulation in the plasma, skin, feces, and liver. Hundreds of cases have been studied and the results for this gene-disease relationship have held over time. Of note, EPP cases have been reported in Americans, Europeans and Japanese. No cases have been reported in black Africans.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (10.45 points): 10 probands were scored with 15 unique variants (one nonsense, one frameshift, eight missense, five splicing defects). We opted not to score autosomal dominant reported cases prior to the early 2000’s that lacked genotype information for the common hypomorphic IVS3-48T>C position. We increased the score for the common IVS3-48T>C defect from (.1) to (.5) since there was functional data demonstrating aberrant splicing and nonsense mediated decay.\n\nSummary of Experimental Evidence (3 points): This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including three mouse models (PMID:28093505, PMID: 8325637, PMID: 9989256), multiple crystal structures (PMID: 17884090, PMID: 24043703, PMID: 17261801), and the FECH enzyme activity assay (PMID:16385445).\nIn summary, FECH has been definitively associated with the autosomal recessive condition, erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP).  This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \nThis gene-disease relationship has held over time (>10 years) with no conflicting associations.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d1b6529d-0a99-4ffd-9bbf-6bc15d76cb10"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
