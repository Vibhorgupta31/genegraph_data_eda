Four variants (missense, frameshift) that have been reported in four probands in two publications (PMIDs: 31585109, 31650526) are included in this curation. The gene appears to be associated with a syndromic phenotype, which includes congenital heart disease, ocular anomalies, hearing loss, developmental delay, and craniofacial malformations. The gene is also associated with autosomal dominant arrhythmic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (OMIM #618920) and was separately curated for that condition. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. No experimental evidence specific to congenital heart disease was found. In summary, there is limited evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 11/27/2023 (SOP Version 10).\nCDH2 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant congenital heart disease in 2019 (Accogli et al., PMID: 31585109).
