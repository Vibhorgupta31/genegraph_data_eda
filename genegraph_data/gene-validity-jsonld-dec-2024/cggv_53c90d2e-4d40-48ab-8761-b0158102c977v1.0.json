However, their genomic investigations provide essential information on the regulation of diseases by their transcripts. Therefore, we examined the gene expression levels of the most important voltage-gated ionic channels such as Na+-channels (SCN5A), Ca2+-channels (CACNA1C and CACNA1H), and K+-channels, including transient outward (KCND2, KCNA2, KCNA5, KCNA8), inward rectifier (KCNJ2, KCNJ12, KCNJ4), and delayed rectifier (KCNB1) in left ventricular tissues from either ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy (ICM or DCM). We also examined the mRNA levels of ATP-dependent K+-channels (KCNJ11, ABCC9) and ERG-family channels (KCNH2). We further determined the mRNA levels of ryanodine receptors (RyR2; ARVC2), phospholamban (PLB or PLN), SR Ca2+-pump (SERCA2; ATP2A1), an accessory protein FKBP12 (PPIASE), protein kinase A (PPNAD4), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2G). The mRNA levels of SCN5A, CACNA1C, and CACNA1H in both groups decreased markedly in the heart samples with similar significance, while KvLQT1 genes were high with depressed Kv4.2. The KCNJ11 and KCNJ12 in both groups were depressed, while the KCNJ4 level was significantly high. More importantly, the KCNA5 gene was downregulated only in the ICM, while the KCNJ2 was upregulated only in the DCM. Besides, mRNA levels of ARVC2 and PLB were significantly high compared to the controls, whereas others (ATP2A1, PPIASE, PPNAD4, and CAMK2G) were decreased. Importantly, the increases of KCNB1 and KCNJ11 were more prominent in the ICM than DCM, while the decreases in ATP2A1 and FKBP1A were more prominent in DCM compared to ICM. Overall, this study was the first to demonstrate that the different levels of changes in gene profiles via different types of cardiomyopathy are prominent particularly in some K+-channels, which provide further information about our knowledge of how remodeling processes can be differentiated in HF originated from different pathological conditions.","dc:creator":"Kepenek ES","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Differential expression of genes participating in cardiomyocyte electrophysiological remodeling via membrane ionic mechanisms and Ca2+-handling in human heart failure."},"rdfs:label":"mRNA expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:53c90d2e-4d40-48ab-8761-b0158102c977_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c13d1056-5619-4f1c-bbd1-8d3da573af03","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:847a6d74-dce8-4077-ac27-4f401cb95656","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The iPSC-CM model could recapitulate the human DCM phenotypes.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30218094","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a structural heart disease that causes dilatation of cardiac chambers and impairs cardiac contractility. The SCN5A gene encodes Nav1.5, the predominant cardiac sodium channel alpha subunit. SCN5A mutations have been identified in patients with arrhythmic disorders associated with DCM. The characterization of Nav1.5 mutations located in the voltage sensor domain (VSD) and associated with DCM revealed divergent biophysical defects that do not fully explain the pathologies observed in these patients. The purpose of this study was to characterize the pathological consequences of a gating pore in the heart arising from the Nav1.5/R219H mutation in a patient with complex cardiac arrhythmias and DCM. We report its properties using cardiomyocytes derived from patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells. We showed that this mutation generates a proton leak (called gating pore current). We also described disrupted ionic homeostasis, altered cellular morphology, electrical properties, and contractile function, most probably linked to the proton leak. We thus propose a novel link between SCN5A mutation and the complex pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias and DCM. Furthermore, we suggest that leaky channels would constitute a common pathological mechanism underlying several neuronal, neuromuscular, and cardiac pathologies.","dc:creator":"Moreau A","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"A leaky voltage sensor domain of cardiac sodium channels causes arrhythmias associated with dilated cardiomyopathy."},"rdfs:label":"hiPSC model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:a1fa5f3c-a835-43dd-a25c-29d7d80a8d62","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b575d05c-2168-4549-b243-aff9cd563b3f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"TG mice recapitulated human DCM phenotypes (heart failure and conduction block)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17512504","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) leads to dilation of the cardiac chambers and congestive heart failure.

Mutations in these channels have recently been associated with atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, conduction disorders, and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).We investigated a young male patient with a mixed phenotype composed of documented conduction disorder, atrial flutter, and ventricular tachycardia associated with DCM. Further family screening revealed DCM in the patient's mother and sister and in three of the mother's sisters. Because of the complex clinical phenotypes, we screened SCN5A and identified a novel mutation, R219H, which is located on a highly conserved region on the fourth helix of the voltage sensor domain of Na(v)1.5. Three family members with DCM carried the R219H mutation.The wild-type (WT) and mutant Na(+) channels were expressed in a heterologous expression system, and intracellular pH (pHi) was measured using a pH-sensitive electrode. The biophysical characterization of the mutant channel revealed an unexpected selective proton leak with no effect on its biophysical properties. The H(+) leak through the mutated Na(v)1.5 channel was not related to the Na(+) permeation pathway but occurred through an alternative pore, most probably a proton wire on the voltage sensor domain.We propose that acidification of cardiac myocytes and/or downstream events may cause the DCM phenotype and other electrical problems in affected family members. The identification of this clinically significant H(+) leak may lead to the development of more targeted treatments.","dc:creator":"Gosselin-Badaroudine P","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"A proton leak current through the cardiac sodium channel is linked to mixed arrhythmia and the dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22675453","rdfs:label":"III.1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Default for supporting functional evidence of variant."},{"id":"cggv:3ab640ba-a84d-481a-8970-afbadc205e55_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:17cbf81f-1106-48f0-a3a0-daae4226e679","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":18,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:3ab640ba-a84d-481a-8970-afbadc205e55_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:da9e5dcd-f3cd-4970-ac3e-48003a804367","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_198056.2(SCN5A):c.611C>A (p.Ala204Glu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA019632"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31930659","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Recently, four SCN5A mutations have been associated with Multifocal Ectopic Purkinje-related Premature Contractions (MEPPC), a rare cardiac syndrome combining polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Here, we identified a novel heterozygous mutation in SCN5A (c.611C>A, pAla204Glu) in a young woman presenting with polymorphic premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and DCM. After failure of antiarrhythmic drugs and an attempt of radiofrequency catheter ablation showing three exit-sites of PVCs, all with presystolic Purkinje potentials, a treatment by hydroquinidine was tried, leading to an immediate and spectacular disappearance of all PVCs and normalization of cardiac function. Electrophysiological studies showed that Nav 1.5-A204E mutant channels exhibited a significant leftward shift of 8 mV of the activation curve, leading to a larger hyperpolarized window current when compared to wild-type. Action potential modeling using Purkinje fiber and ventricular cell models predicted an arrhythmogenic effect predominant in Purkinje fibers for the A204E mutation. Comparison with other MEPPC-associated Nav 1.5 mutations revealed a common electrophysiological pattern of abnormal voltage-dependence of activation leading to a larger hyperpolarized window current as a shared biophysical mechanism of this syndrome. These features of the mutant sodium channels are likely to be responsible for the hyperexcitability of the fascicular-Purkinje system observed in patients with MEPPC.","dc:creator":"Doisne N","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"A novel gain-of-function mutation in SCN5A responsible for multifocal ectopic Purkinje-related premature contractions."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31930659","rdfs:label":"Proband Doisne"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Default based on functional evidence to support pathogenicity of variant."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"cggv:53c90d2e-4d40-48ab-8761-b0158102c977_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8daccef7-7422-4354-a2bc-12fe5e53edd6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f15c6c1b-1faa-41b2-b2ae-96e92bdd4574","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:8daccef7-7422-4354-a2bc-12fe5e53edd6_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:53d97ad8-d117-4a67-b189-636db9228853","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000335.5(SCN5A):c.5321T>C (p.Phe1774Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA352141482"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31514951","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Genotype-phenotype correlations in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and, in particular, the effects of gene variants on clinical outcomes remain poorly understood.","dc:creator":"Gigli M","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Genetic Risk of Arrhythmic Phenotypes in Patients With Dilated Cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31514951","rdfs:label":"169"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Knocked down - no functional evidence"},{"id":"cggv:37a582df-74f2-456d-a8ff-338b2c2a9fe8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8ce53926-b2fd-424b-840e-4cce8e7dffd3","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Genotyping","phenotypeFreeText":"Dilated cardiomyopathy and heart block","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:37a582df-74f2-456d-a8ff-338b2c2a9fe8_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:dc432892-1f6d-42af-97b5-4d68e18a5adb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000335.4(SCN5A):c.2548_2549GT[3] (p.Phe851fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA254808"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15671429"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15671429","rdfs:label":"III.1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Truncating variant with no additional information.

Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and segregation data. Numerous variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense) have been reported in humans with isolated DCM (Olson et al., 2005, PMID: 15671429; Ge et al., 2008, PMID: 19808398; McNair et al., 2011, PMID: 21596231; Morales et al., 2011, PMID: 20458009; Grosselin-Badaroudine et al., 2012, PMID: 22675453; Laurent et al., 2012, PMID: 22766342; Mann et al., 2012, PMID: 22999724; Zakrzewska-Koperska et al., 2018, PMID: 29871609; Calloe et al., 2018, PMID: 29506689; Gigli et al., 2019, PMID: 31514951; Doisne et al., 2020, PMID: 31930659). This gene-disease association is supported by mouse models, a human iPS cell culture model, and expression studies. SCN5A mRNA levels were markedly decreased in heart tissues obtained from DCM patients (Kepenek et al., 2019, PMID: 31520233). The myosin heavy chain-Snail transgenic mice displayed a DCM phenotype with conduction block and marked reduction of SCN5A expression (Hesse, et al., 2007, PMID: 17512504). Heterozygous and homozygous knock-in mouse models harboring SCN5A p.D1275N displayed a DCM phenotype including intraventricular conduction block with marked reduction of cardiac sodium currents (Watanabe et al., 2011, PMID: 21824921). Furthermore, patient-derived human iPS cell-induced cardiomyocytes carrying SCN5A p.R219H showed reduced contraction, prolonged action potential duration, early afterdepolarization, and H+-leak currents (Moreau et al., 2018, PMID: 30218094). In summary, SCN5A is definitively associated with autosomal dominant DCM. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic setting, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on October 9, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:53c90d2e-4d40-48ab-8761-b0158102c977"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
