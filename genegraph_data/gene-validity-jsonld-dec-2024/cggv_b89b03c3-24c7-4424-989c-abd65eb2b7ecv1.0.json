Recently, dominant mutations in the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 gene were found to be associated with three distinct neuromuscular phenotypes: hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 2C, scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrophy and congenital distal spinal muscular atrophy. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 encodes a cation channel previously implicated in several types of dominantly inherited bone dysplasia syndromes. We performed DNA sequencing of the coding regions of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 in a cohort of 145 patients with various types of hereditary neuropathy and identified five different heterozygous missense mutations in eight unrelated families. One mutation arose de novo in an isolated patient, and the remainder segregated in families. Two of the mutations were recurrent in unrelated families. Four mutations in transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 targeted conserved arginine residues in the ankyrin repeat domain, which is believed to be important in protein-protein interactions. Striking phenotypic variability between and within families was observed. The majority of patients displayed a predominantly, or pure, motor neuropathy with axonal characteristics observed on electrophysiological testing. The age of onset varied widely, ranging from congenital to late adulthood onset. Various combinations of additional features were present in most patients including vocal fold paralysis, scapular weakness, contractures and hearing loss. We identified six asymptomatic mutation carriers, indicating reduced penetrance of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 defects. This finding is relatively unusual in the context of hereditary neuropathies and has important implications for diagnostic testing and genetic counselling.","dc:creator":"ZimoÅ„ M","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Dominant mutations in the cation channel gene transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 cause an unusual spectrum of neuropathies."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20460441","rdfs:label":"ZI_CMT-456.01"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Missense w/ variant-level evidence (Studies have shown that this missense change impairs ATP-binding and cellular viability in vitro; PMIDs: 22702953, 21288981)"},{"id":"cggv:9a5ed9d0-3274-400f-bd05-76748a2057b9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:441495a9-a933-4b12-9ab6-9f786b3c312c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was isolated from blood leukocytes and amplified/directly sequenced for TRPV4.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001604","obo:HP_0003474","obo:HP_0009053","obo:HP_0008994","obo:HP_0200101","obo:HP_0008959","obo:HP_0008997","obo:HP_0001609","obo:HP_0001284"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:9a5ed9d0-3274-400f-bd05-76748a2057b9_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:56bf9ca3-a891-4081-86b1-b3e5a51a6efa","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021625.4(TRPV4):c.710G>T (p.Arg237Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA386655927"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27066566","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To characterize 2 novel TRPV4 mutations in 2 unrelated families exhibiting the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2C (CMT2C) phenotype.","dc:creator":"Sullivan JM","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Novel mutations highlight the key role of the ankyrin repeat domain in TRPV4-mediated neuropathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27066566","rdfs:label":"SU1II.2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Missense w/ variant-level evidence (Mutant activity/calcium levels are increased compared to WT)"},{"id":"cggv:bd4d0ebb-7f43-400c-9076-a133eadbe17b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c558e567-aa14-42d9-9091-4a67b22732e9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"detectionMethod":"Mapping showed linkage to chromosome 12q24.11-12q24.21.

Time-dependent TRPV4 expression experiments also showed similar results, with specificity and direct interaction confirmed with further experiments. Four neuropathy-causing variants and two skeletal dysplasia variants were transfected into cell lines to test their effect on the RhoA interaction, with the neuropathy variants universally resulting in near-complete disruption and the dysplasia variants displayed variably preserved interactions. Given that WT and mutant TRPV4 are co-expressed in a tetramer, studies with both WT and neuropathy mutants showed a striking reduction of WT TRPV4-RhoA interaction when in a tetramer with the mutant indicating a gain-of-function mechanism. Furthermore, investigation into the structural consequences of these neuropathy mutants demonstrated that the areas commonly mutated were key for interaction.

Dominant missense mutations of TRPV4 cause distinct, tissue-specific diseases, but the pathogenic mechanisms are unknown. Mutations causing peripheral neuropathy localize to the intracellular N-terminal domain whereas skeletal dysplasia mutations are in multiple domains. Using an unbiased screen, we identified the cytoskeletal remodeling GTPase RhoA as a TRPV4 interactor. TRPV4-RhoA binding occurs via the TRPV4 N-terminal domain, resulting in suppression of TRPV4 channel activity, inhibition of RhoA activation, and extension of neurites in vitro. Neuropathy but not skeletal dysplasia mutations disrupt TRPV4-RhoA binding and cytoskeletal outgrowth. However, inhibition of RhoA restores neurite length in vitro and in a fly model of TRPV4 neuropathy. Together these results identify RhoA as a critical mediator of TRPV4-induced cell structure changes and suggest that disruption of TRPV4-RhoA binding may contribute to tissue-specific toxicity of TRPV4 neuropathy mutations.","dc:creator":"McCray BA","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Neuropathy-causing TRPV4 mutations disrupt TRPV4-RhoA interactions and impair neurite extension."},"rdfs:label":"TRPV4 Neuropathy Mutants Disrupt RhoA Interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b89b03c3-24c7-4424-989c-abd65eb2b7ec_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:14d005fd-2049-4fa3-9fae-b307c60ba64b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2be777bd-f815-4360-944e-50ee57910a9a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Lines of transgenic flies were produced with three types, including WT, R269C, and R269C+M680K, the latter of which includes a TRPV4 ion-conducting pore block mutant. The R269C flies showed inability to expand their wings after eclosion, indicating a neuronal and muscular defect. This was not observed in either of the other two lines, with the co-expression of both R269C and R269C+M680K suppressing the phenotype due to the tetrameric ion channel structure. Expressing the R269C variant later in life also impacted climbing performance, compared to the other two which showed no detrimental effects. The R269C flies showed marked loss of axonal projections and dendritic arborizations compared to the other two lines, indicating neuronal degeneration similar to that in human probands. Investigation revealed that this resulted from impaired development and toxicity in a dose-dependent manner consistent with a gain-of-function mechanism. A TRPV4 antagonist, GSK219, suppressed the neurodegeneration phenotype further supporting TRPV4 as the phenotypic mediator. Further testing identified a potent genetic modifier, CaMKII, that could ameliorate the wing phenotype when knocked out or enhance it when overexpressed in flies. This relationship influences the N_CCAP in Drosophilia, producing hyperexcitability dependent on the intracellular Ca2+ levels. Studies on neurons with R269C demonstrated an increased Ca2+ response than WT in response to agonist stimulation and spontaneous calcium transients, indicating that this mutation sensitizes the channels consistent with the gain-of-function mechanism predicted.

For this purpose, a number of tests and observations were performed on the models in order to characterize the phenotypes and potential mechanisms affecting them. Swimming thrash assays and crawling capacity for mechanical reststance were both tested, with knockouts having reduced function and motility compared to the WT. Motor neuron morphology appeared relatively unchanged, suggesting neuronal degeneration is not a major driver of defects which supports the calcium-related toxicity pathogenic mechanism. Body wall muscles were characterized via multiple tests, with the osm-9 KO animals showing muscle cell degeneration and deposits, a moderate decrease in average filament length, and an increased gap to total muscle cell ratio compared to the WT. Most notably, the osm-9 KO animals responded poorly to levamisole, having an overall less significant change in body length, indicating functional defecits of body wall muscle contractility. They also took significantly less time to reach full paralysis than WT animals.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32294113","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is an inherited peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy. The disease is divided into demyelinating (CMT1) and axonal (CMT2) neuropathies, and although we have gained molecular information into the details of CMT1 pathology, much less is known about CMT2. Due to its clinical and genetic heterogeneity, coupled with a lack of animal models, common underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In order to gain an understanding of the normal function of genes associated with CMT2, and to draw direct comparisons between them, we have studied the behavioural, cellular and molecular consequences of mutating nine different genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (lin-41/TRIM2, dyn-1/DNM2, unc-116/KIF5A, fzo-1/MFN2, osm-9/TRPV4, cua-1/ATP7A, hsp-25/HSPB1, hint-1/HINT1, nep-2/MME). We show that C. elegans defective for these genes display debilitated movement in crawling and swimming assays. Severe morphological defects in cholinergic motors neurons are also evident in two of the mutants (dyn-1 and unc-116). Furthermore, we establish methods for quantifying muscle morphology and use these to demonstrate that loss of muscle structure occurs in the majority of mutants studied. Finally, using electrophysiological recordings of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) activity, we uncover reductions in spontaneous postsynaptic current frequency in lin-41, dyn-1, unc-116 and fzo-1 mutants. By comparing the consequences of mutating numerous CMT2-related genes, this study reveals common deficits in muscle structure and function, as well as NMJ signalling when these genes are disrupted.","dc:creator":"Soh MS","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Disruption of genes associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 lead to common behavioural, cellular and molecular defects in Caenorhabditis elegans."},"rdfs:label":"Roundworm TRPV4 Knockout"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Although this model does demonstrate that TRPV4 has a similar function in roundworms as in humans, there is a signficant difference between the phenotypes observed in each generally due to the wide species gap.

Variants in this gene, which encodes a cell surface calcium-permeable cation channel, have been associated with several disorders including skeletal dysplasias (Brachyolmia, Metatropic dysplasia, etc.), motor-neuropathies (congenital/scapuloperoneal spinal muscle atrophy), and a motor-sensory neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease). As the latter two groups are generally considered a spectrum of disease with variable severity (Toft-Bertelsen and MacAulay, PMID: 33467654), these entities have been evaluated together for the purposes of this curation. The skeletal dysplasias will be evaluated separately. At least fifteen unique variants, usually missense, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least eighteen probands in five publications (PMIDs: 20037586, 20037588, 27066566, 20460441, 25900305). Variants in this gene also segregated with the disorder in over twenty-five additional family members, the majority of which were confirmed via whole exome sequencing. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is gain-of-function, typically with the mutant incorporating with the wild-type into tetrameric channels and causing variable trafficking modifications. TRPV4 variants do not show any significant genotype-phenotype correlation, with the harboring domain bearing little relation to the resulting phenotypic entity (Toft-Bertelsen and MacAulay).Â \nThis gene-disease association is additionally supported by a limited amount of experimental evidence. Functional evidence demonstrates that neuropathy mutants disrupt TRPV4's interaction with the GTPase RhoA, as there is a striking reduction of wildtype TRPV4-RhoA interaction when in a tetramer with the neuropathy mutants and no effect with dysplasia mutants (McCray et al., PMID: 33664271). The mild phenotype of TRPV4-null mice and undesirable side effects of TRPV4 inhibitors limit the usefulness of traditional animal models, however there have been several that elucidate some amount of evidence towards the gene's pathogenicity (Everaerts et al., PMID: 20956320). Both a roundworm and drosophila model have been characterized, with the drosophila model utilizing a common neuropathy variant p.Arg269Cys that resulted in variable neuronal and muscular defects. Notably, these effects could be suppressed via TRPV4 inhibitors or ion-channel disruption, indicating a dose-dependent toxic gain-of-function that matched the human probands (Woolums et al., PMID: 32471994).\nIn summary, TRPV4 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant neuromuscular disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b89b03c3-24c7-4424-989c-abd65eb2b7ec"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
