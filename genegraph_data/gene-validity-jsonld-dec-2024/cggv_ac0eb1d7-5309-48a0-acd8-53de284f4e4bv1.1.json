Here we attempted to systematically summarize and clarify the association between the SNP and sports-related tendon and ligament injuries risk. Six eligible studies including 933 cases and 1,381 controls were acquired from PubMed, Web Of Science and Cochrane library databases. Significant association was identified in homozygote model (TT versus GG: OR=0.17, 95%CI 0.08-0.35, PH=0.00) and recessive model (TT versus GT/GG: OR=0.21, 95%CI 0.10-0.44, PH=0.00).

This anchor region is bordered by a microunfolding region, 15 amino acids in each chain, which include no proline or hydroxyproline residues and contain a chymotrypsin cleavage site. Glycine substitutions and amino acid deletions within the N-anchor domain induce its reversible unfolding above 34 degrees C. The overall triple helix denaturation temperature is reduced by 5-6 degrees C, similar to complete N-anchor removal. N-propeptide partially restores the stability of mutant procollagen but not sufficiently to prevent N-anchor unfolding and a conformational change at the N-propeptide cleavage site. The ensuing failure of N-proteinase to cleave at the misfolded site leads to incorporation of pN-collagen into fibrils. Similar, but weaker, effects are caused by G88E substitution in the adjacent triplet, which appears to alter N-anchor structure as well. As in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) VIIA/B, fibrils containing pN-collagen are thinner and weaker causing EDS-like laxity of large and small joints and paraspinal ligaments. However, distinct structural consequences of N-anchor destabilization result in a distinct alpha1(I)-osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)/EDS phenotype.","dc:creator":"Makareeva E","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Molecular mechanism of alpha 1(I)-osteogenesis imperfecta/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: unfolding of an N-anchor domain at the N-terminal end of the type I collagen triple helix."},"rdfs:label":"Incomplete or delayed N-propeptide cleavage"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:ac0eb1d7-5309-48a0-acd8-53de284f4e4b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5be7f32b-4eb8-43a5-9452-554c6238ba91","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:60c6fc15-b3a6-497b-8d2c-a3720f453b63","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"This mouse model mirrors skin and bone fragility.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24443344","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"By using a genome-wide N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced dominant mutagenesis screen in mice, a founder with low bone mineral density (BMD) was identified. Mapping and sequencing revealed a T to C transition in a splice donor of the collagen alpha1 type I (Col1a1) gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 9 and a predicted 18-amino acid deletion within the N-terminal region of the triple helical domain of Col1a1. Col1a1(Jrt) /+ mice were smaller in size, had lower BMD associated with decreased bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) and reduced trabecular number, and furthermore exhibited mechanically weak, brittle, fracture-prone bones, a hallmark of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Several markers of osteoblast differentiation were upregulated in mutant bone, and histomorphometry showed that the proportion of trabecular bone surfaces covered by activated osteoblasts (Ob.S/BS and N.Ob/BS) was elevated, but bone surfaces undergoing resorption (Oc.S/BS and N.Oc/BS) were not. The number of bone marrow stromal osteoprogenitors (CFU-ALP) was unaffected, but mineralization was decreased in cultures from young Col1a1(Jrt) /+ versus +/+ mice. Total collagen and type I collagen content of matrices deposited by Col1a1(Jrt) /+ dermal fibroblasts in culture was âˆ¼40% and 30%, respectively, that of +/+ cells, suggesting that mutant collagen chains exerted a dominant negative effect on type I collagen biosynthesis. Mutant collagen fibrils were also markedly smaller in diameter than +/+ fibrils in bone, tendon, and extracellular matrices deposited by dermal fibroblasts in vitro. Col1a1(Jrt) /+ mice also exhibited traits associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS): Their skin had reduced tensile properties, tail tendon appeared more frayed, and a third of the young adult mice had noticeable curvature of the spine. Col1a1(Jrt) /+ is the first reported model of combined OI/EDS and will be useful for exploring aspects of OI and EDS pathophysiology and treatment.","dc:creator":"Chen F","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"First mouse model for combined osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"COL1A1 deficient mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:ac0eb1d7-5309-48a0-acd8-53de284f4e4b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":11}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6999,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:9c435fa7-ba68-4c48-93d6-e3b369bc4a3f","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0030854","gene":"hgnc:2197","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"*COL1A1* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant combined osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 1 (EDS/OI) in 2005 (Cabral et al., PMID: 15728585). Combined osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-1 (OIEDS1) is an autosomal dominant generalized connective tissue disorder characterized by features of both osteogenesis imperfecta (bone fragility, long bone fractures, blue sclerae) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (joint hyperextensibility, soft and hyperextensible skin, abnormal wound healing, easy bruising, vascular fragility). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into eight disease entities, osteogenesis imperfecta, type I (OMIM:166200), osteogenesis imperfecta, type II (OMIM:166210), osteogenesis imperfecta, type III (OMIM:259420), osteogenesis imperfecta, type IV (OMIM:166220), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, arthrochalasia type, 1 (OMIM:130060), combined osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 1 (OMIM:619115), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, classic type, 1 (not associated with *COL1A1* in OMIM), and Caffey disease (OMIM:114000). The split curations have been curated separately. Ten variants (missense) that have been reported in eleven probands in four publications (PMIDs: 15728585, 17078022, 17206620, 23692737) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be due to interference with N-propeptide removal (PMID: 23692737). This gene-disease association is also supported by evidence supporting abnormal biochemical function consistent with disease, expression studies throughout the skeletal system, tendons, ligaments, and sclerae, and a mouse model recapitulating the human phenotype (animal models, expression studies, biochemical function studies) (PMIDs: 6519194, 16407265, 19669491, 24443344, 28206959). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *COL1A1* and autosomal dominant combined osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date September 7, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ac0eb1d7-5309-48a0-acd8-53de284f4e4b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
