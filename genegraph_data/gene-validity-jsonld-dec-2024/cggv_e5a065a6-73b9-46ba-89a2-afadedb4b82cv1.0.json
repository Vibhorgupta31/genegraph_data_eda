Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) is one type of severe teratozoospermia and results from a variety of flagellar defects. In this study, we conducted whole-exome sequencing to identify and evaluate the genetic lesions in two patients with potential PCD and MMAF. Biallelic mutations in exon 10, c.983G>A; p.(Gly328Asp), and exon 29, c.3532G>A; p.(Asp1178Asn), of the CFAP74 (NM_001304360) gene were identified in patient 1 (P1), and biallelic mutations in exon 7, c.652C>T; p.(Arg218Trp), and exon 35, c. 4331G>C; p.(Ser1444Thr), of the same gene were identified in patient 2 (P2). Bioinformatic analysis suggested that these variants may be disease causing. Immunofluorescence confirmed that CFAP74 was absent in these patients' sperm samples. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was carried out for P1, and his wife became pregnant after embryo transfer and gave birth to a healthy baby. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to identify the importance of CFAP74 in potential PCD and MMAF, contributing to the genetic diagnosis of these disorders and helping to predict pregnancy outcomes relevant in in vitro fertilization.","dc:creator":"Sha Y","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Biallelic mutations of CFAP74 may cause human primary ciliary dyskinesia and MMAF phenotype."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e5a065a6-73b9-46ba-89a2-afadedb4b82c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e5a065a6-73b9-46ba-89a2-afadedb4b82c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8632cb96-a853-4260-a5bf-f9b94ddfbf95","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:138f126f-41f3-4e08-b987-1911fb24335b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23715323","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of loci for common diseases, but, for the majority of these, the mechanisms underlying disease susceptibility remain unknown.

Compound heterozygous missense variants in *CFAP74* were identified in 2 unrelated Chinese probands with suspected PCD and diagnosed with multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF). Both patients had bronchiectasis, chronic sinusitis, chronic wet cough and male infertility. MMAF was characterised by multiple sperm tail defects (short, bent, coiled, abnormally wide or absent flagella), incomplete mitochondrial sheath and disorganised outer dense fibres and microtubules. A second publication in 2022 (Biebach et al., PMID: 36047773) reported compound heterozygous frameshift variants leading to premature truncation in 2 siblings and an unrelated patient with suspected PCD (based on bronchiectasis, recurrent airway infections, chronic wet cough and recurrent sinusitis). One of these probands was also diagnosed with MMAF. In probands from both publications, nasal nitric oxide levels were normal and laterality defects were not observed. Biopsies from respiratory cilia also showed normal ciliary ultrastructure; however, cilia showed reduced ciliary beat frequency and slightly reduced beating amplitude with a partially stiff as well as rotatory pattern. In addition, neonatal respiratory distress was not reported in any of the patients, and PCD was diagnosed in adult age in all patients except one patient at age 14. Please note that the genetic evidence for this curation is limited, and there remains an urgent need for publication of additional probands to support this gene-disease association and to better establish the spectrum of phenotypes associated with CFAP74-related disease.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that human tissues exhibiting the highest levels of *CFAP74* expression include tissue types relevant to disease and known to have motile cilia, including the lung, fallopian tube, brain, and testis (PMID: 23715323). A *Chlamydomonas* model shows that the ortholog *FAP74* encodes a subunit of the C1d projection of the central apparatus. *FAP74* mutant *Chlamydomonas* strains show reduced ciliary beat frequencies and altered waveforms, including uncoordinated flagella with defects in propagating bends and switching between effective and recovery strokes (PMID: 33809498, PMID: 20421426). These data constitute a partial match to patient sperm samples, which showed absent CFAP74 expression in flagella, compared to high CFAP74 expression in control sperm flagella (PMID: 32555313). However, there is a lack of immunofluorescence data on CFAP74 localisation in multiciliated cells from affected vs. control human patients, as well as a lack of patient cell evidence confirming a central complex protein defect, such as mislocalization of another protein as a consequence of CFAP74 absence. The lack of availability of these details ultimately limited the scoring of the genetic evidence from these patients.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support the relationship between *CFAP74* and autosomal recessive primary ciliary dyskinesia 49, without situs inversus (MIM#: 620197). Additional case-level evidence with more detailed characterization of the central complex would be required to reach a higher classification. However, the existing evidence may make stronger case for future investigation of a potential relationship between *CFAP74* and spermatogenic failure. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on October 12th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e5a065a6-73b9-46ba-89a2-afadedb4b82c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
