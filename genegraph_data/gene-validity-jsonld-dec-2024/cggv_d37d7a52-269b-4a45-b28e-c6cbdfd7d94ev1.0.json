Parents provided consent to be informed of diagnostic results in the fetus, medically actionable findings in the parents, and their identification as carrier couples for significant autosomal recessive conditions. We assessed the perceptions and understanding of exome sequencing using mixed methods in 15 mother-father dyads.ResultsIn seven (47%) of 15 fetuses, exome sequencing provided a diagnosis or possible diagnosis with identification of variants in the following genes: COL1A1, MUSK, KCTD1, RTTN, TMEM67, PIEZO1 and DYNC2H1. One additional case revealed a de novo nonsense mutation in a novel candidate gene (MAP4K4). The perceived likelihood that exome sequencing would explain the results (5.2 on a 10-point scale) was higher than the approximately 30% diagnostic yield discussed in pretest counseling.ConclusionExome sequencing had diagnostic utility in a highly select population of fetuses where a genetic diagnosis was highly suspected.

However, the mechanisms by which these mutations result in RBC dehydration are unknown. In this study, we show that RBCs exhibit robust calcium entry in response to mechanical stretch and that this entry is dependent on Piezo1 expression. Furthermore, RBCs from blood-cell-specific Piezo1 conditional knockout mice are overhydrated and exhibit increased fragility both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that Yoda1, a chemical activator of Piezo1, causes calcium influx and subsequent dehydration of RBCs via downstream activation of the KCa3.1 Gardos channel, directly implicating Piezo1 signaling in RBC volume control.

Here, we demonstrate that a mechanically activated ion channel Piezo1 senses oscillating shear stress (OSS) and incorporates the signal into the genetic program controlling lymphatic valve development and maintenance. Time-controlled deletion of Piezo1 using a pan-endothelial Cre driver (Cdh5[PAC]-CreERT2) or lymphatic-specific Cre driver (Prox1-CreERT2) equally inhibited lymphatic valve formation in newborn mice. Furthermore, Piezo1 deletion in adult lymphatics caused substantial lymphatic valve degeneration. Piezo1 knockdown in cultured lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) largely abrogated the OSS-induced upregulation of the lymphatic valve signature genes. Conversely, ectopic Piezo1 overexpression upregulated the lymphatic valve genes in the absence of OSS. Remarkably, activation of Piezo1 using chemical agonist Yoda1 not only accelerated lymphatic valve formation in animals, but also triggered upregulation of some lymphatic valve genes in cultured LECs without exposure to OSS. In summary, our studies together demonstrate that Piezo1 is the force sensor in the mechanotransduction pathway controlling lymphatic valve development and maintenance, and Piezo1 activation is a potentially novel therapeutic strategy for congenital and surgery-associated lymphedema.","dc:creator":"Choi D","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Piezo1 incorporates mechanical force signals into the genetic program that governs lymphatic valve development and maintenance."},"rdfs:label":"Down steam gene induction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"Additional paper replicates the same result PMID: 30482854\n"},{"id":"cggv:de234e6a-cadb-4ac8-bf14-91590207fd1b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf406e1a-edb5-43e0-8265-6e70968f37c4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Both loss of function and gain of function of PIEZO1 is associated with DHS.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26001274","rdfs:label":"YODA stimulation of Red Blood Cell "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.75},{"id":"cggv:d37d7a52-269b-4a45-b28e-c6cbdfd7d94e_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b7c19a3f-fd2f-40f5-bca9-680f00b5fa33","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:089fe34b-02a5-4812-8c87-6d1594312d45","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Loss of channel activity","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867393","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Missense mutations in the gene that encodes for the mechanically-gated ion channel Piezo1 have been linked to a number of diseases.

Based upon current nomenclature in the literature, we have decided to refer to lymphatic malformation 6 as “generalized lymphatic dyplasia” or “GLD”. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found likely differences in molecular mechanisms between autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive disease and therefore these disease entities have been split into separate entities at this time. These two disease entities do show significant phenotypic overlap and therefore, these may later be lumped together if evidence permits. The split curation of autosomal dominant dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis with or without pseudohyperkalemia and/or perinatal edema has been curated separately.\n\nGeneralized lymphatic dysplasia (GLD) is a multigenic disorder characterized by primary systemic lymphedema in multiple body systems presenting prenatally or postnatally with pleural effusions, chylothoraces and/or pericardial effusions, ascites or limb edema. Facial cellulitis has been reported in multiple individuals with biallelic PIEZO1 variants and these GLD patients and unaffected carriers have consistently been found to have a mild, asymptomatic form of DHS with mild hemolysis, reduced erythrocyte osmotic resistance, or spherocytes and stomatocytes on blood smear.\n\nIn 2015, Fotiou et al (PMID: 26333996) performed exome sequencing on individuals from six unrelated families with generalized lymphatic dysplasia and identified homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in the PIEZO1 gene that segregated with disease, the majority of which were putative loss of function. Lukas et al in 2015 performed whole exome sequencing on a pair of sibs with GLD and identified compound heterozygosity for a PIEZO1 splice site variant c.3455+1G>A and a missense variant p.Glu2029Arg. Functional studies and expression data supported loss of function for both variants. Since that time, additional families with autosomal recessive GLD, with putative (truncating or splice site) or proven loss of function missense variants in PIEZO1 have been reported (PMIDs: 28518170, 30244526, 30930797, 28749478, 33227434, 31680349, 36453701).\n\nMechanotransduction is a critical regulator of lymphatic vascular development, and shear stress via fluid flow promotes lymphatic vessel growth and valve formation. Animal models support the role of PIEZO1 in the developing blood and lymphatic vasculature. Mice lacking PIEZO1 show embryonic lethality due to heart and angiogenic defects (PMID 25119035, 24958852). Endothelial or lymphatic endothelial specific PIEZO1 knockout showed PIEZO1 is required for lymphatic valve formation and restricting growth of lymphatic capillaries (PMID 30482854, 30676326, 35701867). In cultured blood and lymphatic endothelial cells, PIEZO1 knockdown is associated with reduced responses to flow observed as changes in the cytoskeleton and activation of downstream flow-responsive signaling pathways (PMID 25119035, 30482854, 35701867, 30676326). When overexpressed in 239T/HEK cells, truncation and some missense variants in PIEZO1 have demonstrated reduced protein expression and stability, failure to localize to the cell surface, and disrupted glycosylation which is associated with reduced channel activity in response to stretch or treatment with the PIEZO1 specific activator YODA (PMID: 34867393, 26387913, 32251670, 34489534). These studies all support a loss of function or dominant negative mechanism for several truncating, splice site or missense variants in affected individuals.\n\nSubstantial evidence supports this gene-disease relationship including case-level data and experimental data that support loss of PIEZO1 function in individuals with GLD. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence has been reached. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between PIEZO1 and autosomal recessive generalized lymphatic dysplasia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Prenatal GCEP on the meeting date March 22nd, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\nThe maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence has been reached. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
