In lymphoblast cell lines derived from severe and mild forms of GAN, mutations in gigaxonin are shown to yield highly unstable proteins, thereby permitting a rapid diagnostic test for the spectrum of GAN mutations as an alternative to invasive nerve biopsy or systematic sequencing of the GAN gene. Gigaxonin has been proposed as a substrate adaptor for an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which affects proteasome-dependent degradation of microtubule-related proteins including MAP1B, MAP8 and the tubulin folding chaperone TBCB. We demonstrate that, unlike its counterpart TBCE, TBCB only moderately destabilizes microtubules. Neither TBCB abundance nor microtubule organization or densities are altered in GAN mutant fibroblasts, thus demonstrating that altered TBCB levels are not primary determinants of IF disorganization in GAN. Characteristic GAN mutant-induced ovoid aggregates of vimentin are not produced in normal fibroblasts after disrupting microtubule assembly, either by TBCE overexpression or depolymerizing drugs. Thus, IF disorganization in GAN fibroblasts is independent of TBCB and microtubule loss and must be regulated by a yet unidentified mechanism.","dc:creator":"Cleveland DW","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Gigaxonin controls vimentin organization through a tubulin chaperone-independent pathway."},"rdfs:label":"GAN expressed in human brain and murine neuronal tissues "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Three PMIDs are used for scoring of the expression "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b9f65afa-5cb1-457e-abff-ab110145a32d_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:80138d5b-c7fb-4d63-82df-9ad09930d7e7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:03d09080-a85d-4aa8-92b4-ad7fffc25976","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"GAN-/- neurons exhibited large perinuclear bundles of ATG16L1 within the soma at 4 div (days in vitro), with a pronounced increase in abundance.

Similar to Shh inhibition, repression of gigaxonin in zebrafish impaired motor neuron specification and somitogenesis and abolished neuromuscular junction formation and locomotion. Shh signaling was impaired in gigaxonin-null zebrafish and was corrected by both pharmacological activation of the Shh pathway and human gigaxonin, pointing to an evolutionary-conserved mechanism regulating Shh signaling.

Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN, MIM 256850), a severe, autosomal recessive sensorimotor neuropathy affecting both the peripheral nerves and the central nervous system, is characterized by neurofilament accumulation, leading to segmental distension of the axons. GAN corresponds to a generalized disorganization of the cytoskeletal intermediate filaments (IFs), to which neurofilaments belong, as abnormal aggregation of multiple tissue-specific IFs has been reported: vimentin in endothelial cells, Schwann cells and cultured skin fibroblasts, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in astrocytes. Keratin IFs also seem to be alterated, as most patients present characteristic curly or kinky hairs. We report here identification of the gene GAN, which encodes a novel, ubiquitously expressed protein we have named gigaxonin. We found one frameshift, four nonsense and nine missense mutations in GAN of GAN patients. Gigaxonin is composed of an amino-terminal BTB (for Broad-Complex, Tramtrack and Bric a brac) domain followed by a six kelch repeats, which are predicted to adopt a beta-propeller shape. Distantly related proteins sharing a similar domain organization have various functions associated with the cytoskeleton, predicting that gigaxonin is a novel and distinct cytoskeletal protein that may represent a general pathological target for other neurodegenerative disorders with alterations in the neurofilament network.","dc:creator":"Bomont P","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"The gene encoding gigaxonin, a new member of the cytoskeletal BTB/kelch repeat family, is mutated in giant axonal neuropathy."}},"rdfs:label":" Family IV proband "},{"id":"cggv:5fd0bc0a-3350-4cea-9b9f-4d8eb61bc963","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5fd0bc0a-3350-4cea-9b9f-4d8eb61bc963_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":3969,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":17,"subject":{"id":"cggv:57adba10-1135-4527-8aaa-7a06517b6205","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009749","gene":"hgnc:4137","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The GAN locus was first located to chromosome 16q24.1 by homozygosity mapping in three unrelated consanguineous Tunisian families with Giant axonal neuropathy in 1997 (PMID: 10732815, 1997). The locus was later refined to a smaller interval in 2000 (PMID: 10909853). Within the same year, Bomont and colleagues were able to identify the GAN gene (PMID: 11062483).  GAN contains 11 exons and encodes a 597 aa protein that they named gigaxonin. \nGigaxonin is a subunit of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, containing a BTB domain at its N-terminal and a Kelch domain at its C-terminal. It plays key roles in sustaining neuron survival and cytoskeleton architecture. Gigaxonin is a low abundance protein, ubiquitously expressed in human and murine tissues, although found to be enriched in the nervous system and during murine prenatal stages (PMID: 19168853, PMID: 11062483, PMID: 21486449). \nGiant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease affecting both peripheral and central nervous system, first described in 1972 (PMID: 4339350, PMID: 21356581). A prominent pathological feature of GAN is the presence of giant axons densely packed with aberrant intermediate filaments (IFs) (PMID: 33192535). Classical form of GAN presents as severe peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy during infancy and evolves into central nervous system impairment including seizures, cerebellar signs, and cognitive impairment. Nerve conduction studies show normal to moderately reduced nerve conduction velocity (NCV), and severely reduced compound motor action potentials. Patients become wheel chair bound during the second decade with death by early adulthood. Milder forms with later onset and minor alterations of the CNS were also reported (PMID: 11062483). \nA total of 14 pathogenic homozygous and compound heterozygous variants were identified in 12 out of the 15 initial families tested (PMID: 11062483). To date, more than 80 variants distributed throughout the coding sequence, including missense, splice, truncating and structural variants, have been reported in patients with GAN (PMID: 33192535, PMID: 19231187, PMID: 21356581, PMID: 15897506, PMID: 12668605, PMID: 17578852). Some of these variants are enriched in particular populations, with possible founder effect in Turkey (c.1502+G>T) and Algeria (p.R477X). Inter- and intra-familial clinical heterogeneity reported in patients carrying the same variant (PMID: 19231187). \nMore genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship including case-level data and segregation data is available in the literature, but the maximum score (12 pts.) has been reached.\nThere are three different GAN knockout mouse models generated to date (PMID: 21486449, PMID: 18680552, PMID: 16565160). They all have mild phenotype although the absence of gigaxonin had a striking impact on cytoskeletal architecture. Accumulation of intermediate filaments was also evidenced in a number of cellular models, including dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from GAN KO mice (PMID: 27000625), GAN-deficient neuroblastoma cell lines (PMID: 31944090), patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived motor neurons (PMID: 25398950), among others. Furthermore, neurons from GAN KO mice exhibited inhibition of autophagosome synthesis, unveiling a fundamental role of gigaxonin in controlling the autophagy pathway. \nAs KO mice do not mimic the axonal defects that are hallmarks of human GAN, recently generated zebrafish KO model stand out as the first robust animal model for GAN, reproducing both neuronal loss and loss of motility, as in GAN patients.  Morphological, behavioral and cellular deficits were rescued by human gigaxonin (PMID: 31503551). \nIn summary, GAN gene is DEFINITELY associated with autosomal recessive Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b9f65afa-5cb1-457e-abff-ab110145a32d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
