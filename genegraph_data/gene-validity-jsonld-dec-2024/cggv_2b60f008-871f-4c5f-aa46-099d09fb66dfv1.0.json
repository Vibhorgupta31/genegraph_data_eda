Among the latter are the intermediate filaments (IFs), a large family of proteins mutated in more than 30 human diseases. For example, mutations in the DES gene, which encodes the IF desmin, lead to desmin-related myopathy and cardiomyopathy. Here, we demonstrate that myotubularin (MTM1), which is mutated in individuals with X-linked centronuclear myopathy (XLCNM; also known as myotubular myopathy), is a desmin-binding protein and provide evidence for direct regulation of desmin by MTM1 in vitro and in vivo. XLCNM-causing mutations in MTM1 disrupted the MTM1-desmin complex, resulting in abnormal IF assembly and architecture in muscle cells and both mouse and human skeletal muscles. Adeno-associated virus-mediated ectopic expression of WT MTM1 in Mtm1-KO muscle reestablished normal desmin expression and localization. In addition, decreased MTM1 expression and XLCNM-causing mutations induced abnormal mitochondrial positioning, shape, dynamics, and function. We therefore conclude that MTM1 is a major regulator of both the desmin cytoskeleton and mitochondria homeostasis, specifically in skeletal muscle. Defects in IF stabilization and mitochondrial dynamics appear as common physiopathological features of centronuclear myopathies and desmin-related myopathies.","dc:creator":"Hnia K","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Myotubularin controls desmin intermediate filament architecture and mitochondrial dynamics in human and mouse skeletal muscle."},"rdfs:label":"RT-PCR"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:98c20253-786c-4087-8f3e-77d597f6de19","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6246d815-fa54-4ded-a783-8a6aa1971b11","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Northern blot analysis shows expression of MTM1 in skeletal tissue in human tissue.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8640223","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (MTM1) is characterized by severe hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness, with impaired maturation of muscle fibres.

Mutations in myotubularin cause myotubular myopathy, a devastating congenital myopathy with unclear pathogenesis and no current therapies. Myotubular myopathy was the first described of a growing list of conditions caused by mutations in proteins implicated in membrane trafficking. To advance the understanding of myotubularin function and disease pathogenesis, we have created a zebrafish model of myotubular myopathy using morpholino antisense technology. Zebrafish with reduced levels of myotubularin have significantly impaired motor function and obvious histopathologic changes in their muscle. These changes include abnormally shaped and positioned nuclei and myofiber hypotrophy. These findings are consistent with those observed in the human disease. We demonstrate for the first time that myotubularin functions to regulate PI3P levels in a vertebrate in vivo, and that homologous myotubularin-related proteins can functionally compensate for the loss of myotubularin. Finally, we identify abnormalities in the tubulo-reticular network in muscle from myotubularin zebrafish morphants and correlate these changes with abnormalities in T-tubule organization in biopsies from patients with myotubular myopathy. In all, we have generated a new model of myotubular myopathy and employed this model to uncover a novel function for myotubularin and a new pathomechanism for the human disease that may explain the weakness associated with the condition (defective excitation-contraction coupling). In addition, our findings of tubuloreticular abnormalities and defective excitation-contraction coupling mechanistically link myotubular myopathy with several other inherited muscle diseases, most notably those due to ryanodine receptor mutations. Based on our findings, we speculate that congenital myopathies, usually considered entities with similar clinical features but very disparate pathomechanisms, may at their root be disorders of calcium homeostasis.","dc:creator":"Dowling JJ","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Loss of myotubularin function results in T-tubule disorganization in zebrafish and human myotubular myopathy."},"rdfs:label":"Zebra Fish Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:07601963-0c13-49d3-bc1d-9220dbb14f96","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b1488602-b59b-4e51-8216-2ae24aecee84","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The model shows that mice experience generalized muscle weakness and respiratory issues.

The disease was proposed to result from an arrest in myogenesis, as the skeletal muscle from patients contains hypotrophic fibers with centrally located nuclei that resemble fetal myotubes. To understand the physiopathological mechanism of XLMTM, we have generated mice lacking myotubularin by homologous recombination. These mice are viable, but their lifespan is severely reduced. They develop a generalized and progressive myopathy starting at around 4 weeks of age, with amyotrophy and accumulation of central nuclei in skeletal muscle fibers leading to death at 6-14 weeks. Contrary to expectations, we show that muscle differentiation in knockout mice occurs normally. We provide evidence that fibers with centralized myonuclei originate mainly from a structural maintenance defect affecting myotubularin-deficient muscle rather than a regenerative process. In addition, we demonstrate, through a conditional gene-targeting approach, that skeletal muscle is the primary target of murine XLMTM pathology.

Female carriers are usually asymptomatic but they may present with muscular weakness because of a hypothesized skewed pattern of X-chromosome inactivation. By combining next generation sequencing (NGS) and CGH array approaches, we have investigated the role of MTM1 variants in a large cohort of undiagnosed patients with a wide spectrum of myopathies. Seven novel XLMTM patients have been identified, including two girls with an unremarkable family history for myotubular myopathy. Moreover, we have detected and finely mapped a large deletion causing a myotubular myopathy with abnormal genital development. Our data confirm that the severe neonatal onset of the disease in male infants is sufficient to address the direct molecular testing toward the MTM1 gene and, above all, suggest that the number of undiagnosed symptomatic female carriers is probably underestimated.

This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, functional alterations in patient cells, and expression studies.
