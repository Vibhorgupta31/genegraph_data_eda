We now demonstrate that the PRKAR1alpha gene encoding the R1alpha regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) maps to this chromosome 17q24 locus. Furthermore, we show that PRKAR1alpha frameshift mutations in three unrelated families result in haploinsufficiency of R1alpha and cause Carney complex. We did not detect any truncated R1alpha protein encoded by mutant PRKAR1alpha. Although cardiac tumorigenesis may require a second somatic mutation, DNA and protein analyses of an atrial myxoma resected from a Carney complex patient with a PRKAR1alpha deletion revealed that the myxoma cells retain both the wild-type and the mutant PRKAR1alpha alleles and that wild-type R1alpha protein is stably expressed. However, in this atrial myxoma, we did observe a reversal of the ratio of R1alpha to R2beta regulatory subunit protein, which may contribute to tumorigenesis.

CNC is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and the genes responsible have been mapped to 2p16 and 17q22-24 (refs 6, 7). Because of its similarities to the McCune-Albright syndrome and other features, such as paradoxical responses to endocrine signals, genes implicated in cyclic nucleotide-dependent signalling have been considered candidates for causing CNC (ref. 10). In CNC families mapping to 17q, we detected loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the vicinity of the gene (PRKAR1A) encoding protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1-alpha (RIalpha), including a polymorphic site within its 5' region. We subsequently identified three unrelated kindreds with an identical mutation in the coding region of PRKAR1A. Analysis of additional cases revealed the same mutation in a sporadic case of CNC, and different mutations in three other families, including one with isolated inherited cardiac myxomas. Analysis of PKA activity in CNC tumours demonstrated a decreased basal activity, but an increase in cAMP-stimulated activity compared with non-CNC tumours.

(2000). Multiple case level studies have been performed with CNC patients that have variants in the PRKAR1A gene. Western-blot analysis of primary cell lines from multiple patients indicate that nonsense and frameshift mutations led to NMD. prkar1a\u0002 +/− mice exhibited extracardiac tumorigenesis, developed sarcomas and hepatocellular carcinomas as well as thyroid, adrenocortical and mesenchymal tumors, which sharing similar phenotypes to CNC patients. In patient cells from three families, both the stimulation of kinase activity with cAMP and the inhibition of that stimulation by PKI were greater in CNC tumours than in those in the control samples. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the PRKAR1A gene and Carney complex, type 1.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:fc16b2a9-c8dc-4a04-a029-2f6af049404d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
