Causative mutations in 8 genes (NPHP1-8) have been identified, and homologous mouse models for NPHP2/INVS and NPHP3 have been described. The jck mouse is another model of recessive cystic kidney disease, and this mouse harbors a missense mutation, G448V, in the highly conserved RCC1 domain of Nek8. We hypothesized that mutations in NEK8 might cause nephronophthisis in humans, so we performed mutational analysis in a worldwide cohort of 588 patients. We identified 3 different amino acid changes that were conserved through evolution (L330F, H425Y, and A497P) and that were absent from at least 80 ethnically matched controls. All 3 mutations were within RCC1 domains, and the mutation H425Y was positioned within the same RCC1 repeat as the mouse jck mutation. To test the functional significance of these mutations, we introduced them into full-length mouse Nek8 GFP-tagged cDNA constructs. We transiently overexpressed the constructs in inner medullary collecting duct cells (IMCD-3 cell line) and compared the subcellular localization of mutant Nek8 to wild-type Nek8. All mutant forms of Nek8 showed defects in ciliary localization to varying degrees; the H431Y mutant (human H425Y) was completely absent from cilia and the amount localized to centrosomes was decreased. Overexpression of these mutants did not affect overall ciliogenesis, mitosis, or centriole number. Our genetic and functional data support the assumption that mutations in NEK8 cause nephronophthisis (NPHP9), adding another link between proteins mutated in cystic kidney disease and their localization to cilia and centrosomes.","dc:creator":"Otto EA","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"NEK8 mutations affect ciliary and centrosomal localization and may cause nephronophthisis."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6888a91a-6589-42a9-9622-553b4918bed6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6888a91a-6589-42a9-9622-553b4918bed6_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:89fb3f8e-44a2-453a-b962-893c332a00c7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fb0fb06c-43bf-489c-992c-f8dfafafa5da","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Skin fibroblasts from families with compound heterozygous mutations\nNEK8 was absent from cilia in fibroblasts with missense mutations and detected in cytoplasmic juxtanuclear vesicular compartment â€“ Golgi apparatus.

In order to identify novel genes whose mutations would cause severe developmental ciliopathies, >500 patients/fetuses were analyzed by a targeted high throughput sequencing approach allowing exome sequencing of >1200 ciliary genes. NEK8/NPHP9 mutations were identified in five cases with severe overlapping phenotypes including renal cystic dysplasia/hypodysplasia, situs inversus, cardiopathy with hypertrophic septum and bile duct paucity. These cases highlight a genotype-phenotype correlation, with missense and nonsense mutations associated with hypodysplasia and enlarged cystic organs, respectively. Functional analyses of NEK8 mutations in patient fibroblasts and mIMCD3 cells showed that these mutations differentially affect ciliogenesis, proliferation/apoptosis/DNA damage response, as well as epithelial morphogenesis. Notably, missense mutations exacerbated some of the defects due to NEK8 loss of function, highlighting their likely gain-of-function effect. We also showed that NEK8 missense and loss-of-function mutations differentially affect the regulation of the main Hippo signaling effector, YAP, as well as the expression of its target genes in patient fibroblasts and renal cells. YAP imbalance was also observed in enlarged spheroids of Nek8-invalidated renal epithelial cells grown in 3D culture, as well as in cystic kidneys of Jck mice. Moreover, co-injection of nek8 MO with WT or mutated NEK8-GFP RNA in zebrafish embryos led to shortened dorsally curved body axis, similar to embryos injected with human YAP RNA. Finally, treatment with Verteporfin, an inhibitor of YAP transcriptional activity, partially rescued the 3D spheroid defects of Nek8-invalidated cells and the abnormalities of NEK8-overexpressing zebrafish embryos. Altogether, our study demonstrates that NEK8 human mutations cause major organ developmental defects due to altered ciliogenesis and cell differentiation/proliferation through deregulation of the Hippo pathway.

In the collecting tubules and collecting ducts of wild-type mice, we found that Nek8 was localized to the proximal portion of primary cilia and was weakly detected in the cytosol.

Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Nek8 interacted with polycystin-2, but not with polycystin-1, and that the jck mutation did not affect this interaction. Western blot analysis and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR revealed that the protein and mRNA expression of polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2) were increased in jck mouse kidneys. The jck mutation also led to abnormal phosphorylatin of PC2, and this was associated with longer cilia and ciliary accumulation of PC1 and PC2.

Exome sequencing demonstrated compound heterozygous mutations in the NEK8 gene (Never in mitosis A-related Kinase 8), a ciliary kinase indispensable for cardiac and renal development based on murine studies. The mutations included a c.2069_2070insC variant (p.Ter693LeufsTer86), and a c.1043C>T variant (p.Thr348Met) in the highly conserved RCC1 (Regulation of Chromosome Condensation 1) domain. The RCC1 domain is crucial for localization of the NEK8 protein to the centrosomes and cilia. Mutations in NEK8 have been previously reported in three fetuses (from a single family) with renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia 2 (RHPD2), similar to Ivemark syndrome, and in three individuals with nephronophthisis (NPHP9). This is the third report of disease-causing mutations in the NEK8 gene in humans and only the second describing multi-organ involvement. The clinical features we describe differ from those in the previously published report in that (1) a pancreatic phenotype was not observed in the individuals reported here, (2) there were more prominent cardiac findings, (consistent with observations in murine models), and (3) we observed bile duct hypoplasia rather than ductal plate malformation. The patients reported here expand our understanding of the NEK8-associated phenotype. Our findings highlight the variable phenotypic expressivity and the spectrum of clinical manifestations due to mutations in the NEK8 gene.","dc:creator":"Rajagopalan R","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Compound heterozygous mutations in NEK8 in siblings with end-stage renal disease with hepatic and cardiac anomalies."}},{"id":"cggv:223bc385-6fc4-46e5-86ec-97767b3c1fa2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:e66853b7-eb84-45a6-93d9-a7b4b7a3f4e5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26697755"}],"rdfs:label":"Born at 40 weeks gestation "},{"id":"cggv:223bc385-6fc4-46e5-86ec-97767b3c1fa2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:223bc385-6fc4-46e5-86ec-97767b3c1fa2_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:a123fb96-f0c6-4512-8d5f-6fadc99117ae","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a123fb96-f0c6-4512-8d5f-6fadc99117ae_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:8c10c95b-0883-445e-8069-759c15a5fd1e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8c10c95b-0883-445e-8069-759c15a5fd1e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"WeeksGestation","ageValue":40,"allele":{"id":"cggv:90e9a432-cb22-4739-b9a9-356bf4f4d7ce","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_178170.3(NEK8):c.47+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA398418765"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:15256c4d-af01-41cf-9657-be0ecde2de8f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:90e9a432-cb22-4739-b9a9-356bf4f4d7ce"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26967905"},"rdfs:label":"Family 4"},{"id":"cggv:15256c4d-af01-41cf-9657-be0ecde2de8f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:15256c4d-af01-41cf-9657-be0ecde2de8f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4965,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:ab784964-6071-48b4-8f2b-a1bb6e3da960","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014174","gene":"hgnc:13387","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"NEK8 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive nephronophthisis (NPHP9; OMIM: 613824) by Otto et al in 2008 (PMID:8199800) and to autosomal recessive renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia (RHPD2; OMIM: 615415), where there are cysts in the kidney, liver and pancreas, and often cardiac anomalies and bowed femora, by Rajagopalan et al in 2016 (PMID:26697755). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working group, we found no difference in the molecular mechanisms or inheritance pattern. Therefore both of these disease entities were lumped into one disease entity. Null variants, splicing variants and missense variants in NEK8 have been reported in at least 6 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 18199800, 26697755, 26862157, 26967905). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by protein interactions, expression studies, functional alterations in patient and non-patient cells, non-human model organisms, cell culture models, and rescue of both a model organisms and cell culture models (PMIDs: 12421721, 18235101, 23274954, 23793029, 26967905). In summary, NEK8 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia 2. This has been reportedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. There was however some discussion about whether this condition should be called a ciliopathy rather than a form of nephronophthisis since the clinical features were more consistent with a ciliopathy. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP Working Group on 9/8/2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6888a91a-6589-42a9-9622-553b4918bed6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
