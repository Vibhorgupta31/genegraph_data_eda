MLH1 protein and PMS2 protein form a heterodimer called MutLα, which is required for the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. Defective MMR pathway is responsible for microsatellite instability, a type of genomic instability that is characteristic for tumor cells. *MLH1* has been linked to Lynch Syndrome (autosomal dominant) and mismatch repair cancer syndrome (autosomal recessive), which were curated separately. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, curations to refute or dispute can be split when needed. This curation focuses on refuting the association with breast cancer. Evidence curated in this gene-disease relationship includes case-control data.\n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 0 point** \nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 3 case-control studies at the aggregate variant level. In 2021, a large case-control study [BCAC (PMID: 33471991) with more than 48 thousand cases and controls] did not identify a significant association of aggregate loss of function (LOF) variants in *MLH1* and breast cancer. Likewise, another two large case-control studies published in 2017 screened breast cancer cases from commercial laboratories and did not find significant association of pathogenic mutations in *MLH1* with breast cancer (PMID: 28418444, 35172496).\n \n**Overall Summary:**\nIn summary, given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, and lack of experimental evidence, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between *MLH1* and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as disputed by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 6/14/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 6/9/2023 (SOP Version 9).\nGiven the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, and lack of experimental evidence, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between MLH1 and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c27a22e4-fc45-4888-8b1d-625bc649697c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
