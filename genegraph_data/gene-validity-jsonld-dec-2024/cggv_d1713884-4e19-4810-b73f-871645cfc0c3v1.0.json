Here we show that mutations in prickle genes are associated with seizures in humans, mice, and flies. We identified human epilepsy patients with heterozygous mutations in either PRICKLE1 or PRICKLE2. In overexpression assays in zebrafish, prickle mutations resulted in aberrant prickle function. A seizure phenotype was present in the Prickle1-null mutant mouse, two Prickle1 point mutant (missense and nonsense) mice, and a Prickle2-null mutant mouse. Drosophila with prickle mutations displayed seizures that were responsive to anti-epileptic medication, and homozygous mutant embryos showed neuronal defects. These results suggest that prickle mutations have caused seizures throughout evolution.","dc:creator":"Tao H","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Mutations in prickle orthologs cause seizures in flies, mice, and humans."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d1713884-4e19-4810-b73f-871645cfc0c3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d1713884-4e19-4810-b73f-871645cfc0c3_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:851b0822-f50c-4865-ae42-fc5d5fb665c4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:18efde62-dcf1-470f-828a-517e120faeee","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Even though the Drosophila model showed seizures, the Drosophila has only one prickle gene but does not have homolog of specific PRICKLE2 of the human genome.

(Tao et al., PMID: 21276947). At the time of this curation, there were no other single-gene disorders associated with this gene. This curation is based on this disease entity only. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. 4 variants (missense, nonsense and frameshift) that have been reported in 4 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 21276947, 29390993, 34092786) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF, but it is still unclear. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
