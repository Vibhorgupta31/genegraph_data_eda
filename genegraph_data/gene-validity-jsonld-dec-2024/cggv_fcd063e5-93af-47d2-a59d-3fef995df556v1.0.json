Indviduals reported with the disorder all share extra-oral halitosis with a specific \"cabbage-like\"odor caused by elevated levels of methanethiol and dimethylsulfide in the breath. Additionally, indviduals with the disorder demonstrate reduced SELENBP1 protien levels and methanethiol oxidase activity. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least 4 variants (nonsense, missense and splicing) have been reported in 3 probands from 1 publication (PMID:29255262). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member. The gene *SELENBP1* encodes an enzyme that serves as a methanethiol oxidase, converting methanethiol, oxygen, and water to formaldehyde, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen peroxide. \n\nThis gene-disease association is further supported by its biochemical function as a methane oxidase in kinetic assays (PMID:29255262) and a knockout mouse model (PMID:29255262) which recapitulates the phenotype of evelated DMS levels in plasma and DMSO2 with decreased Methane Oxidase activity. Additionally, Bulk tissue expression data from the GTEx project demonstrates that *SELENBP1* is primary expressed in the transverse colon, supporting its function as a methane oxidase as methanethiol is produced in the large intestine. Finally, in nonpatient cells, variants of *SELENBP1* were found to have loss and impairment of Methanethiol oxidase function as indicated by little to no detectable H2S and H2O2 generation. In summary, *SELENBP1* is moderately associated with autosomal recessive extraoral halitosis due to methanethiol oxidase deficiency.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 11/11/2022.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:fcd063e5-93af-47d2-a59d-3fef995df556"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
