Endoglin cannot bind ligand on its own but requires the presence of the signaling receptors, supporting a critical role for the interaction between endoglin and TbetaRI or TbetaRII. This study shows that full-length endoglin interacts with both TbetaRI and TbetaRII, independently of their kinase activation state or the presence of exogenous TGF-beta1. Truncated constructs encoding either the extracellular or the cytoplasmic domains of endoglin demonstrated that the association with the signaling receptors occurs through both extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. However, a more specific mapping revealed that the endoglin/TbetaRI interaction was different from that of endoglin/TbetaRII. TbetaRII interacts with the amino acid region 437-558 of the extracellular domain of endoglin, whereas TbetaRI interacts not only with the region 437-558 but also with the protein region located between amino acid 437 and the N terminus. Both TbetaRI and TbetaRII interact with the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin, but TbetaRI only interacts when the kinase domain is inactive, whereas TbetaRII remains associated in its active and inactive forms. Upon association, TbetaRI and TbetaRII phosphorylate the endoglin cytoplasmic domain, and then TbetaRI, but not TbetaRII, kinase dissociates from the complex. Conversely, endoglin expression results in an altered phosphorylation state of TbetaRII, TbetaRI, and downstream Smad proteins as well as a modulation of TGF-beta signaling, as measured by the reporter gene expression. These results suggest that by interacting through its extracellular and cytoplasmic domains with the signaling receptors, endoglin might affect TGF-beta responses.","dc:creator":"Guerrero-Esteo M","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of endoglin interact with the transforming growth factor-beta receptors I and II."},"rdfs:label":"Guerrero-Esteo_Biochemical Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The evidence is scored default points."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:fbbb72c5-84a0-4096-8d49-6df506cfee0e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:077c728b-39aa-4e1e-9066-c844b0c07b24","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:290ca705-2204-487a-9373-d7502cbb278b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Thalidomide significantly reduced the frequency of epistaxis and increased average hemoglobin concentration.

The effects of thalidomide treatment were partially reversed by pharmacological or genetic interference with PDGF signaling from endothelial cells to pericytes.

The majority of patients carry mutations in either Endoglin (ENG) or ACVRL1 (also known as ALK1) genes, and the disease is characterized by arteriovenous malformations and persistent haemorrhage. ENG and ACVRL1 encode receptors for the TGFÎ² superfamily of ligands, that are essential for angiogenesis in early development but their roles are not fully understood. Our goal was to examine the role of Acvrl1 in vascular endothelial cells during vascular development and to determine whether loss of endothelial Acvrl1 leads to arteriovenous malformations. Acvrl1 was depleted in endothelial cells either in early postnatal life or in adult mice. Using the neonatal retinal plexus to examine angiogenesis, we observed that loss of endothelial Acvrl1 led to venous enlargement, vascular hyperbranching and arteriovenous malformations. These phenotypes were associated with loss of arterial Jag1 expression, decreased pSmad1/5/8 activity and increased endothelial cell proliferation. We found that Endoglin was markedly down-regulated in Acvrl1-depleted ECs showing endoglin expression to be downstream of Acvrl1 signalling in vivo. Endothelial-specific depletion of Acvrl1 in pups also led to pulmonary haemorrhage, but in adult mice resulted in caecal haemorrhage and fatal anaemia.

In cultured endothelial cells, ALK1 and another TGF-beta type I receptor, ALK5, regulate angiogenesis by controlling TGF-beta signal transduction, and ALK5 is required for ALK1 signaling.

Alk1-conditional deletion resulted in severe vascular malformations mimicking all pathologic features of HHT. Yet Alk5- or Tgfbr2-conditional deletion in mice, or Alk5 inhibition in zebrafish, did not affect vessel morphogenesis.

Because heterozygous mice contain the appropriate genotype for an animal model of this disorder, mice heterozygous for a loss-of-function mutation in Acvrl1 were carefully examined for an HHT-like phenotype. These mice developed age-dependent vascular lesions in the skin, extremities, oral cavity and in the internal organs (lung, liver, intestine, spleen and brain), similar to those seen in HHT patients. Major histopathological features of the lesions included thin-walled dilated vessels in close proximity to each other, hemorrhage and fibrosis.

HHT2 is evaluated by the presence of 3 or more of the Curacao criteria (PMID: 10751092). ACVRL1 is a type I TGF-Î² receptor and interacts with ENG in the TGF-Î² pathway. ENG is known to cause HHT1. The mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency (PMID: 15879500) and at least 571 ACVRL1 variants, ranging from missense, in-frame indel to nonsense, frameshift, large deletions and whole gene deletions, have been reported in humans (http://www.arup.utah.edu/database/ACVRL1/ACVRL1_welcome.php). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data and experimental data. Variants included in this curation come from 13 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs 86402252, 17384219, 26176610, 9245985 20364125, 20414677) and segregated with disease in 12 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence evidence (12 pts) has been reached.  This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models and in vitro functional assays. A number of mouse and zebra fish models have been developed for HHT (PMID: 17911384, 12588795, 24896812, 12050147). Additionally, interaction with  the HHT-related gene *ENG* in the TGF-Î² pathway has been experimentally demonstrated (PMID: 15702480, 12015308).  In summary, *ACVRL1* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, Type 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.

Multiple variant types, including missense, have been reported and the carboxy terminus contains a conserved 11 amino acid NANDOR box in the protein kinase domain that shows enrichment of rare missense variants among PAH-HHT cases compared to HHT alone (PMID:20056902). Experimental evidence for a gene-disease relationship for HHT-PAH includes expression in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells and PAH plexiform lesions (PMID: 11484689), interaction with receptor ligand BMP10 (PMID: 17068149), and spontaneous pulmonary hypertension in an Acvrl1 knockout HHT mouse model (PMID: 21859819).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:fbbb72c5-84a0-4096-8d49-6df506cfee0e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
