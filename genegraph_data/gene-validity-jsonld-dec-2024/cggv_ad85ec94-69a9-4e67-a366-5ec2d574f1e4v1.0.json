These include the perinatal lethal short-rib polydactyly syndromes (SRPS) and the less severe asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD), Ellis-van Creveld (EVC) syndrome, and cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED) phenotypes. To identify new genes and define the spectrum of mutations in the skeletal ciliopathies, we analyzed 152 unrelated families with SRPS, ATD, and EVC. Causal variants were discovered in 14 genes in 120 families, including one newly associated gene and two genes previously associated with other ciliopathies. These three genes encode components of three different ciliary complexes; FUZ, which encodes a planar cell polarity complex molecule; TRAF3IP1, which encodes an anterograde ciliary transport protein; and LBR, which encodes a nuclear membrane protein with sterol reductase activity. The results established the molecular basis of SRPS type IV, in which mutations were identified in four different ciliary genes. The data provide systematic insight regarding the genotypes associated with a large cohort of these genetically heterogeneous phenotypes and identified new ciliary components required for normal skeletal development.","dc:creator":"Zhang W","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Expanding the genetic architecture and phenotypic spectrum in the skeletal ciliopathies."}},{"id":"cggv:3aadb767-3ee3-4889-9eda-bc6d52814e46_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:82ab026a-8d3b-432d-8283-a0304128e170"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29068549"}],"rdfs:label":"Zhang_R99-392C"},{"id":"cggv:3aadb767-3ee3-4889-9eda-bc6d52814e46","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3aadb767-3ee3-4889-9eda-bc6d52814e46_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:1b56141f-cdf7-4c81-8a9b-e573589eeab0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1b56141f-cdf7-4c81-8a9b-e573589eeab0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:703e496a-9340-4a3b-9f74-42138c00ce81_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:703e496a-9340-4a3b-9f74-42138c00ce81","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Hours","ageValue":2,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:171510a9-68fa-4921-824d-d3386d809cf9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018051.5(DYNC2I1):c.2246C>T (p.Thr749Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA210596"}},{"id":"cggv:8c5126bb-b21e-4948-85ea-1e449b1d0821","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018051.5(DYNC2I1):c.1891C>T (p.Gln631Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA210594"}}],"detectionMethod":"Using whole-exome capture and massive parallel sequencing of DNA from an affected Australian individual with SRPS type III, they detected two novel heterozygous mutations in WDR60","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003026","obo:HP_0002240","obo:HP_0001159","obo:HP_0100732","obo:HP_0100259","obo:HP_0000007","obo:HP_0000773"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:6a1b4984-9560-427b-88ee-caf1c03bcfb4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:171510a9-68fa-4921-824d-d3386d809cf9"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23910462","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Short-rib polydactyly syndromes (SRPS I-V) are a group of lethal congenital disorders characterized by shortening of the ribs and long bones, polydactyly, and a range of extraskeletal phenotypes. A number of other disorders in this grouping, including Jeune and Ellis-van Creveld syndromes, have an overlapping but generally milder phenotype. Collectively, these short-rib dysplasias (with or without polydactyly) share a common underlying defect in primary cilium function and form a subset of the ciliopathy disease spectrum. By using whole-exome capture and massive parallel sequencing of DNA from an affected Australian individual with SRPS type III, we detected two novel heterozygous mutations in WDR60, a relatively uncharacterized gene. These mutations segregated appropriately in the unaffected parents and another affected family member, confirming compound heterozygosity, and both were predicted to have a damaging effect on the protein. Analysis of an additional 54 skeletal ciliopathy exomes identified compound heterozygous mutations in WDR60 in a Spanish individual with Jeune syndrome of relatively mild presentation. Of note, these two families share one novel WDR60 missense mutation, although haplotype analysis suggested no shared ancestry. We further show that WDR60 localizes at the base of the primary cilium in wild-type human chondrocytes, and analysis of fibroblasts from affected individuals revealed a defect in ciliogenesis and aberrant accumulation of the GLI2 transcription factor at the centrosome or basal body in the absence of an obvious axoneme. These findings show that WDR60 mutations can cause skeletal ciliopathies and suggest a role for WDR60 in ciliogenesis.","dc:creator":"McInerney-Leo AM","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Short-rib

Utilizing the visible immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated the interaction modes among the dynein-2 subunits, including previously undefined interactions, such as that between WDR60 and the TCTEX1D2-DYNLT1/DYNLT3 dimer. The dynein-2 complex can be divided into three subcomplexes, namely DYNC2H1-DYNC2LI1, WDR34-DYNLL1/DYNLL2-DYNLRB1/DYNLRB2, and WDR60-TCTEX1D2-DYNLT1/DYNLT3. We established cell lines lacking WDR60 or TCTEX1D2, both of which are dynein-2-specific subunits encoded by ciliopathy-causing genes, and found that both WDR60-knockout (KO) and TCTEX1D2-KO cells show defects in retrograde ciliary protein trafficking, with WDR60-KO cells demonstrating more severe defects probably due to failed assembly of the dynein-2 complex. The exogenous expression of a WDR60 mutant lacking TCTEX1D2 binding partially restored retrograde trafficking to a level comparable to that of TCTEX1D2-KO cells. Thus, our results demonstrated that WDR60 plays a major role and TCTEX1D2 plays an auxiliary role in the dynein-2 complex to mediate retrograde ciliary protein trafficking.","dc:creator":"Hamada Y","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Interaction of WDR60 intermediate chain with TCTEX1D2 light chain of the dynein-2 complex is crucial for ciliary protein trafficking."},"rdfs:label":"Hamada_Protein-protein interactions"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ad85ec94-69a9-4e67-a366-5ec2d574f1e4_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cbf69aed-8cdd-4d7d-a815-8b9a35ffa7f3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e6384597-ab2c-4ebd-b483-998768d10053","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Graphs show a decreased percentage of ciliated cells in fibroblasts prepared from affected individuals versus control fibroblast lines","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23910462","rdfs:label":"McInerney-Leo_Functional Alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:ad85ec94-69a9-4e67-a366-5ec2d574f1e4_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:621586d5-0ce9-4822-b316-b024bc7c16d6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:06d8dbf3-5e85-4f53-bb2d-aac32d2bf506","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"They found that wdr-60 mutants have reduced dynein-2 recruitment and incorporation into cilia, accompanied by impaired retrograde IFT.

However, the mechanisms that regulate dynein-2 motility remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the Caenorhabditis elegans WDR60 homologue, WDR-60, and dissect the roles of this intermediate chain using genome editing and live imaging of endogenous dynein-2/IFT components. We find that loss of WDR-60 impairs dynein-2 recruitment to cilia and its incorporation onto anterograde IFT trains, reducing retrograde motor availability at the ciliary tip. Consistent with this, we show that fewer dynein-2 motors power WDR-60-deficient retrograde IFT trains, which move at reduced velocities and fail to exit cilia, accumulating on the distal side of the transition zone. Remarkably, disrupting the transition zone's NPHP module almost fully restores ciliary exit of underpowered retrograde trains in wdr-60 mutants. This work establishes WDR-60 as a major contributor to IFT, and the NPHP module as a roadblock to dynein-2 passage through the transition zone.","dc:creator":"De-Castro ARG","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"WDR60-mediated dynein-2 loading into cilia powers retrograde IFT and transition zone crossing."},"rdfs:label":"De-Castro_C. elegans model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:f2bac9f8-e7be-4e77-8c41-479e84880778","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:150a1d45-e070-45ed-8e3d-156f66769529","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The Wdr60 PB/PB embryos had much less cilia than WT embryos.

SRTD8 efers to a group of autosomal recessive skeletal ciliopathies that are characterized by a constricted thoracic cage, short ribs, shortened tubular bones, and a 'trident' appearance of the acetabular roof. Five missense, two nonsense, one frameshift, and one duplication that have been reported in seven probands in four publications (PMIDs: 23910462, 26874042, 29068549, 36381051) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity at this time is unknown. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional alteration of patient cells, protein-protein interactions, and animal models (PMIDs: 23910462, 29742051, 34739033, 37228654). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *DYNC2I1* and autosomal recessive short-rib thoracic dysplasia 8 with or without polydactyly.
