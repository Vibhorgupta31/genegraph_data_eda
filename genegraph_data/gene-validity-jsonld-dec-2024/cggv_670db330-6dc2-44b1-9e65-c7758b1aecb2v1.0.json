Central to the pathogenesis of MEDNIK syndrome is abnormal AP-1-mediated trafficking of copper transporters; this abnormal trafficking results in a hybrid phenotype combining the copper-deficiency-related characteristics of Menkes disease and the copper-toxicity-related characteristics of Wilson disease. We describe three individuals from two unrelated families in whom a MEDNIK-like phenotype segregates with two homozygous null variants in AP1B1, encoding the large β subunit of the AP-1 complex. Similar to individuals with MEDNIK syndrome, the affected individuals we report display abnormal copper metabolism, evidenced by low plasma copper and ceruloplasmin, but lack evidence of copper toxicity in the liver. Functional characterization of fibroblasts derived from affected individuals closely resembles the abnormal ATP7A trafficking described in MEDNIK syndrome both at baseline and in response to copper treatment.

Mechanotransduction occurs within the hair bundle, whereas synaptic transmission takes place at the basolateral membrane. The molecular basis of the development and maintenance of the apical and basal compartments in sensory hair cells is poorly understood. Here we describe auditory/vestibular mutants isolated from forward genetic screens in zebrafish with lesions in the adaptor protein 1 beta subunit 1 (ap1b1) gene. Ap1b1 is a subunit of the adaptor complex AP-1, which has been implicated in the targeting of basolateral membrane proteins. In ap1b1 mutants we observed that although the overall development of the inner ear and lateral-line organ appeared normal, the sensory epithelium showed progressive signs of degeneration. Mechanically-evoked calcium transients were reduced in mutant hair cells, indicating that mechanotransduction was also compromised. To gain insight into the cellular and molecular defects in ap1b1 mutants, we examined the localization of basolateral membrane proteins in hair cells. We observed that the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase pump (NKA) was less abundant in the basolateral membrane and was mislocalized to apical bundles in ap1b1 mutant hair cells. Accordingly, intracellular Na(+) levels were increased in ap1b1 mutant hair cells. Our results suggest that Ap1b1 is essential for maintaining integrity and ion homeostasis in hair cells.","dc:creator":"Clemens Grisham R","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in ap1b1 cause mistargeting of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase pump in sensory hair cells."},"rdfs:label":"Zebrafish models "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:670db330-6dc2-44b1-9e65-c7758b1aecb2_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:daabcf19-c915-4149-b7bd-81e58c6476b2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:daabcf19-c915-4149-b7bd-81e58c6476b2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:c860c9cf-1f69-4b75-bada-614bb9a60fb4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001127.4(AP1B1):c.1852C>T (p.Gln618Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA411120655"}},{"id":"cggv:a6923322-31e8-4c70-b0af-accc30fb02b1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001127.4(AP1B1):c.2677C>T (p.Gln893Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA411117194"}}],"detectionMethod":"c.1852C > T p.\nGln618*/c.2596C\n> T\np.

It is characterized by syndromic early-onset ichthyosis, alopecia, severe sensorineural hearing loss, as well as failure to thrive, mild developmental delay, and later-onset palmoplantar keratoderma. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, Autosomal Recessive Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness Syndrome (KIDAR MIM #242150). Eleven variants (including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and large deletions involving exons 1-2 of the gene) have been reported in 10 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 31630791, 31630788, 33452671, 33349978, 35144013, 37657632, 32969855) and are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional characterization of fibroblasts derived from affected individuals and from animal models (zebrafish), which show abnormal ATP7A trafficking and auditory defects paralleling the hearing loss in our human subjects with AP1B1 mutations (PMIDs: 31630791, 23593334). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between AP1B1 and autosomal recessive Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen IEM GCEP on the meeting date August, 9, 2024.
