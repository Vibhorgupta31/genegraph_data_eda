It has previously been implicated in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia by association studies. Most recently, de novo missense mutations in this gene were identified in autistic patients. However, the causative nature of these mutations remained controversial. Here, we report inactivating mutations in the Ankyrin 3 (ANK3) gene in patients with severe cognitive deficits. In a patient with a borderline intelligence, severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism and sleeping problems, all isoforms of the ANK3 gene, were disrupted by a balanced translocation. Furthermore, in a consanguineous family with moderate intellectual disability (ID), an ADHD-like phenotype and behavioral problems, we identified a homozygous truncating frameshift mutation in the longest isoform of the same gene, which represents the first reported familial mutation in the ANK3 gene. The causality of ANK3 mutations in the two families and the role of the gene in cognitive function were supported by memory defects in a Drosophila knockdown model. Thus we demonstrated that ANK3 plays a role in intellectual functioning. In addition, our findings support the suggested association of ANK3 with various neuropsychiatric disorders and illustrate the genetic and molecular relation between a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders.","dc:creator":"Iqbal Z","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Homozygous and heterozygous disruptions of ANK3: at the crossroads of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:668a89e3-477d-434c-8ab4-0bc9ec3504de_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:66c20dfb-a0b4-40c4-b4bf-ee7b37878ea6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:66c20dfb-a0b4-40c4-b4bf-ee7b37878ea6","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":4,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:be0e84cd-229b-4895-8edf-7345eaf4dad0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020987.5(ANK3):c.5582C>T (p.Thr1861Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5511993"}},{"id":"cggv:9bfd6121-cb70-4aeb-b70c-b7450b6fab01","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020987.5(ANK3):c.5992C>T (p.Arg1998Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5511935"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0010864","obo:HP_0002120","obo:HP_0011097","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0000556","obo:HP_0001344","obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0002119","obo:HP_0000708","obo:HP_0001252"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:b6491a28-25db-4a71-ba48-7657a42287dd_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:be0e84cd-229b-4895-8edf-7345eaf4dad0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38988293","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"ANK3 encodes ankyrin-G, a protein involved in neuronal development and signaling. Alternative splicing gives rise to three ankyrin-G isoforms comprising different domains with distinct expression patterns. Mono- or biallelic ANK3 variants are associated with non-specific syndromic intellectual disability in 14 individuals (seven with monoallelic and seven with biallelic variants). In this study, we describe the clinical features of 13 additional individuals and review the data on a total of 27 individuals (16 individuals with monoallelic and 11 with biallelic ANK3 variants) and demonstrate that the phenotype for biallelic variants is more severe. The phenotypic features include language delay (92%), autism spectrum disorder (76%), intellectual disability (78%), hypotonia (65%), motor delay (68%), attention deficit disorder (ADD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (57%), sleep disturbances (50%), aggressivity/self-injury (37.5%), and epilepsy (35%). A notable phenotypic difference was presence of ataxia in three individuals with biallelic variants, but in none of the individuals with monoallelic variants. While the majority of the monoallelic variants are predicted to result in a truncated protein, biallelic variants are almost exclusively missense. Moreover, mono- and biallelic variants appear to be localized differently across the three different ankyrin-G isoforms, suggesting isoform-specific pathological mechanisms.","dc:creator":"Furia F","dc:date":"2024","dc:title":"The phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of individuals with mono- or biallelic ANK3 variants."}},{"id":"cggv:96945fc3-c7c9-4edf-abc8-ae0d0bf40f25_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9bfd6121-cb70-4aeb-b70c-b7450b6fab01"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38988293"}],"rdfs:label":"Furia-Proband-P4"},{"id":"cggv:96945fc3-c7c9-4edf-abc8-ae0d0bf40f25","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:96945fc3-c7c9-4edf-abc8-ae0d0bf40f25_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Missense variant with on functional evidence of pathogenicity"},{"id":"cggv:b6491a28-25db-4a71-ba48-7657a42287dd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b6491a28-25db-4a71-ba48-7657a42287dd_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Missense variant with on functional evidence of pathogenicity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:6e271ece-c6ee-42ef-b46a-19b82ac9c1c6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e271ece-c6ee-42ef-b46a-19b82ac9c1c6","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:272920c1-de0d-4897-9195-b6c54668969e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020987.5(ANK3):c.7987G>A (p.Glu2663Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5511632"}},{"id":"cggv:6dd98e32-7c1e-44f3-aebb-560dd718363d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020987.5(ANK3):c.92G>A (p.Arg31Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5513552"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"White matter hyperintensities","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0001256","obo:HP_0001999","obo:HP_0000717"],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:8b8a145f-139c-46c6-8817-cdcc9b2924c7_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:272920c1-de0d-4897-9195-b6c54668969e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38988293"},{"id":"cggv:297acc61-6d61-409c-a9bf-d15087d5ce09_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6dd98e32-7c1e-44f3-aebb-560dd718363d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38988293"}],"rdfs:label":"Furia-Proband-P1"},{"id":"cggv:8b8a145f-139c-46c6-8817-cdcc9b2924c7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8b8a145f-139c-46c6-8817-cdcc9b2924c7_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Missense variant with no functional evidence of pathogenicity"},{"id":"cggv:297acc61-6d61-409c-a9bf-d15087d5ce09","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:297acc61-6d61-409c-a9bf-d15087d5ce09_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Missense variant with no functional evidence of pathogenicity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f56e80ab-fb7f-47e8-87be-23b4e5b05f8d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f56e80ab-fb7f-47e8-87be-23b4e5b05f8d","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:4ae02fe9-46e0-4e30-bc96-061a219ceee2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020987.5(ANK3):c.9652C>T (p.Leu3218Phe)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16609525"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0012448","obo:HP_0007058"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:cab1c845-e004-4a63-bae9-1c1288bc0fc4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4ae02fe9-46e0-4e30-bc96-061a219ceee2"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26539891","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Development of the human nervous system involves complex interactions among fundamental cellular processes and requires a multitude of genes, many of which remain to be associated with human disease.

Here, we identify a mechanism required for normal neural development in humans that ensures ordered recruitment of gAnkG and β4-spectrin to the AIS. We identified 3 human neurodevelopmental missense mutations located in the neurospecific domain of gAnkG that prevent recruitment of β4-spectrin, resulting in a lower density and more elongated pattern for gAnkG and its partners than in the mature AIS. We found that these mutations inhibit transition of gAnkG from a closed configuration with close apposition of N- and C-terminal domains to an extended state that is required for binding and recruitment of β4-spectrin, and normally occurs early in development of the AIS. We further found that the neurospecific domain is highly phosphorylated in mouse brain, and that phosphorylation at 2 sites (S1982 and S2619) is required for the conformational change and for recruitment of β4-spectrin. Together, these findings resolve a discrete intermediate stage in formation of the AIS that is regulated through phosphorylation of the neurospecific domain of gAnkG.","dc:creator":"Yang R","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Neurodevelopmental mutation of giant ankyrin-G disrupts a core mechanism for axon initial segment assembly."}},{"id":"cggv:ded74ebb-e351-436c-862d-13b2d5e60dbb_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:be0e84cd-229b-4895-8edf-7345eaf4dad0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31451636"}],"rdfs:label":"Yang-Proband-1"},{"id":"cggv:ded74ebb-e351-436c-862d-13b2d5e60dbb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ded74ebb-e351-436c-862d-13b2d5e60dbb_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ded74ebb-e351-436c-862d-13b2d5e60dbb_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Hippocampal neurons from KO mice lacking all Ank3 isoforms were transfected with the 480 kDa Ank3 isoform carrying one of the patient missense variants (T1861M, K2864N, or P2490L) or wild-type Ank3.

Brain-specific isoforms of ANK3 are localized at the nodes of Ranvier and the axon initial segment and are involved in the clustering of voltage-gated ion channels required for the generation and propagation of action potentials. *ANK3* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive intellectual disability in 2013 (Iqbal et al., PMID: 23390136). Clinical findings include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, seizures, and brain imaging abnormalities. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the curation was split by inheritance pattern. This curation focuses on the relationship between *ANK3* and autosomal recessive intellectual disability. The split curation for autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder has been curated separately.\nThree homozygous frameshift variants in this gene have been reported in six affected individuals from three families in three publications (PMIDs: 23390136, 29302074, 32404165). In addition, ten homozygous or compound heterozygous missense variants, most lacking functional evidence of pathogenicity, have been reported in seven families (PMIDs: 26539891, 31451636, 3677705, 38988293). *ANK3* is highly constrained both for loss-of-function and missense variants. The mechanism of pathogenicity is biallelic loss-of-function, which has been suggested to be isoform-specific. *ANK3* encodes three major isoforms: the widely expressed 190 kDa isoform, and the 270 and 480 kDa isoforms, which are primarily expressed in the brain. Recessive variants affect the giant exon domain, which is present only in the longest, 480 kDa isoform, whereas dominant truncating variants are located in the N-terminal domain and disrupt all three transcripts (PMIDs: 34218362, 38988293). Individuals with biallelic variants exhibit a more severe phenotype than those with monoallelic variants (PMID: 38988293). \nThe gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including animal models in mice (PMID: 25552556) and Drosophila (PMID: 18439406, 23390136). \nIn summary, there is moderate evidence supporting the relationship between *ANK3* and autosomal recessive intellectual disability. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 7, 2020 (SOP Version 7). It was reevaluated on October 2, 2024 (SOP Version 11). Although additional families were curated, only one had biallelic loss-of-function variants (PMID: 32404165), and the classification did not change.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:668a89e3-477d-434c-8ab4-0bc9ec3504de"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
