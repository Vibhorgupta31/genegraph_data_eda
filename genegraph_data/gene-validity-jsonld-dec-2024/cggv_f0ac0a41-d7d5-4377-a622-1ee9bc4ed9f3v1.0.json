The detailed metabolism of copper-induced pathology in WD is still unknown. Gene mutations as well as the possible pathways involved in the ATP7B deficiency were documented. The ATP7B gene was analyzed for mutations in 18 Chinese Han families with WD by direct sequencing. Cell viability and apoptosis analysis of ATP7B small interfering RNA (siRNA)-treated human liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells were measured by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and Hoechst 33342 staining. Finally, the expression of B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2), BCL2-associated X protein (BAX), sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), and minichromosome maintenance protein 7 (MCM7) of ATP7B siRNA-treated cells were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) and Western blot analysis. Twenty different mutations including four novel mutations (p.Val145Phe, p.Glu388X, p.Thr498Ser and p.Gly837X) in the ATP7B gene were identified in our families. Haplotype analysis revealed that founder effects for four mutations (p.Arg778Leu, p.Pro992Leu, p.Ile1148Thr and p.Ala1295Val) existed in these families. Transfection of HepG2 cells with ATP7B siRNA resulted in decreased mRNA expression by 86.3%, 93.1% and 90.8%, and decreased protein levels by 58.5%, 85.5% and 82.1% at 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively (All P<0.01). In vitro study revealed that the apoptotic, cell cycle and lipid metabolism pathway may be involved in the mechanism of WD.

These mechanisms come into play in response to a high influx of Cu or during the course of normal Cu metabolism.","dc:creator":"Harris ED","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Cellular copper transport and metabolism."},"rdfs:label":"Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:f0ac0a41-d7d5-4377-a622-1ee9bc4ed9f3_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:44181531-7600-4503-844f-acff48e67663","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b330025a-5f71-42f7-94d3-27e51476ac83","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Murine mottled fibroblast cell line 802-1, which is defective in the mouse homolog of the Menkes disease gene, ATP7A.

To elucidate the function of the Wilson protein, wild-type and mutant Wilson cDNAs were expressed in a Menkes copper transporter-deficient mottled fibroblast cell line defective in copper export. Expression of the wild-type cDNA demonstrated trans-Golgi network localization and copper-dependent trafficking of the Wilson protein identical to previous observations for the endogenously expressed protein in hepatocytes. Furthermore, expression of the Wilson cDNA rescued the mottled phenotype as evidenced by a reduction in copper accumulation and restoration of cell viability. In contrast, expression of an H1069Q mutant Wilson cDNA did not rescue the mottled phenotype, and immunofluorescence studies showed that this mutant Wilson protein was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Consistent with these findings, pulse-chase analysis demonstrated a 5-fold decrease in the half-life of the H1069Q mutant as compared with the wild-type protein. Maintenance of these transfected cell lines at 28 degreesC resulted in localization of the H1069Q protein in the trans-Golgi network, suggesting that a temperature-sensitive defect in protein folding followed by degradation constitutes the molecular basis of Wilson disease in patients harboring the H1069Q mutation. Taken together, these studies describe a tractable expression system for elucidating the function and localization of the copper-transporting ATPases in mammalian cells and provide compelling evidence that the Wilson protein can functionally substitute for the Menkes protein, supporting the concept that these proteins use common biochemical mechanisms to effect cellular copper homeostasis.","dc:creator":"Payne AS","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Functional expression of the Wilson disease protein reveals mislocalization and impaired copper-dependent trafficking of the common H1069Q mutation."},"rdfs:label":"H1069Q"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:fecdaf94-5ab4-4d66-8238-b394d12615bc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf1edc04-f144-4d06-a2ab-0a124b9dc0aa","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Knockdown cells were exposed to copper sulfate for 24 hours and reduced cell viability by 53.3% compared to control treated cells and by 44% compared to ATP7B siRNA treatment alone (p<0.05) and was dose dependent.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23843956","rdfs:label":"siRNA treated HepG2 cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:f0ac0a41-d7d5-4377-a622-1ee9bc4ed9f3_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bcaea040-a329-49c0-8ec2-003f208e352f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f3815ad7-8cc0-49eb-85c4-c521ce7360a0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat is a known animal model for Wilson's disease.

WND (ATP7B) gene, which encodes a putative copper transporting P-type ATPase, is defective in the patients. To investigate the in vivo function of WND protein as well as its intracellular localization, WND cDNA was introduced to the Long-Evans Cinnamon rat, known as a rodent model for Wilson's disease, by recombinant adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. An immunofluorescent study and a subcellular fractionation study revealed the transgene expression in liver and its localization to the Golgi apparatus. Moreover, since the synthesis of holoceruloplasmin is disturbed in the Long-Evans Cinnamon rat, the plasma level of holoceruloplasmin, oxidase-active and copper-bound form, was examined to evaluate the function of WND protein with respect to the copper transport. Consequently, the appearance of holoceruloplasmin in plasma was confirmed by Western blot analysis and plasma measurements for the oxidase activity and the copper content. These findings indicate that introduced WND protein may function in the copper transport coupled with the synthesis of ceruloplasmin and that the Golgi apparatus is the likely site for WND protein to manifest its function.","dc:creator":"Terada K","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Restoration of holoceruloplasmin synthesis in LEC rat after infusion of recombinant adenovirus bearing WND cDNA."},"rdfs:label":"Rat Rescue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:79663807-d7fc-4753-a53d-f45a8608236c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1eae3ada-1d39-435e-94cc-45dd2a8a6d1c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Introduced an early termination codon in the mouse ATP7B mRNA by substituting a portion of exon 2 with a neomycin cassette oriented in the opposite frame.

Mutations in the ATP7B gene lead to Wilson disease, a copper toxicity disorder characterized by dramatic build-up of intracellular hepatic copper with subsequent hepatic and neuro-logical abnormalities. Using homologous recombination to disrupt the normal translation of ATP7B, we have generated a strain of mice that are homozygous mutants (null) for the Wilson disease gene. The ATP7B null mice display a gradual accumulation of hepatic copper that increases to a level 60-fold greater than normal by 5 months of age. An increase in copper concentration was also observed in the kidney, brain, placenta and lactating mammary glands of homo-zygous mutants, although milk from the mutant glands was copper deficient. Morphological abnormalities resembling cirrhosis developed in the majority of the livers from homozygous mutants older than 7 months of age. Progeny of the homozygous mutant females demonstrated neurological abnormalities and growth retardation characteristic of copper deficiency. Copper concentration in the livers of the newborn homozygous null mutants was decreased dramatically.

Variants in ATP7B were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1993 (Bull et al., PMID 8298639). Wilson disease is a disorder of copper metabolism characterized by an accumulation of copper in many organs, particularly the liver and brain. At least 700 unique germline variants have been identified (missense, nonsense, splice site, frameshift) (reviewed in Członkowska et al., 2018; PMID 30190489). This gene-disease relationship is well-known and therefore a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data and experimental data is available in the literature, therefore the maximum score for both genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached. Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. The mutational mechanism for disease is loss of function leading to reduced (or absent) copper-transporter activity (Huster et al., 2012; PMID 22240481). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and animal models. In summary, ATP7B is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Wilson disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 27, 2019.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f0ac0a41-d7d5-4377-a622-1ee9bc4ed9f3"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
