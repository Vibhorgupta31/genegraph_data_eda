Here, we show that mice that express approximately 5% of normal VMAT2 (VMAT2 LO) display age-associated nigrostriatal dopamine dysfunction that ultimately results in neurodegeneration. Elevated cysteinyl adducts to L-DOPA and DOPAC are seen early and are followed by increased striatal protein carbonyl and 3-nitrotyrosine formation. These changes were associated with decreased striatal dopamine and decreased expression of the dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase. Furthermore, we observed an increase in alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity and accumulation and neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta in aged VMAT2 LO mice. Thus, VMAT2 LO animals display nigrostriatal degeneration that begins in the terminal fields and progresses to eventual loss of the cell bodies, alpha-synuclein accumulation, and an L-DOPA responsive behavioral deficit, replicating many of the key aspects of Parkinson's disease. These data suggest that mishandling of dopamine via reduced VMAT2 expression is, in and of itself, sufficient to cause dopamine-mediated toxicity and neurodegeneration in the nigrostriatal dopamine system. In addition, the altered dopamine homeostasis resulting from reduced VMAT2 function may be conducive to pathogenic mechanisms induced by genetic or environmental factors thought to be involved in Parkinson's disease.","dc:creator":"Caudle WM","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Reduced vesicular storage of dopamine causes progressive nigrostriatal neurodegeneration."},"rdfs:label":"Reduced Vesicular Storage of Dopamine Causes neurodegenerati"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:502e9100-4bae-498c-9fcc-4ce745a5d2ae_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4d20f68e-429e-42d0-a453-33c37494b0f4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:456b5b92-a6c9-45a4-8ec4-0c38be719313","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"1.

These mice (KA1) have profound changes in monoamine metabolism and function and survive into adulthood. Specifically, these animals express very low levels of VMAT2, an endogenous protein which sequesters monoamines intracellularly into vesicles, a process that, in addition to being important in normal transmission, may also act to keep intracellular levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters below potentially toxic thresholds. Homozygous mice show large reductions in brain tissue monoamines, motor impairments, enhanced sensitivity to dopamine agonism, and changes in the chemical neuroanatomy of the striatum that are consistent with alterations in the balance of the striatonigral (direct) and striatopallidal (indirect) pathways. The VMAT2-deficient KA1 mice are also more vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in terms of nigral dopamine cell death. We suggest that the mice may be of value in examining, long term, the insidious damaging consequences of abnormal intracellular handling of monoamines. On the basis of our current findings, the mice are likely to prove of immediate interest to aspects of the symptomatology of parkinsonism. They may also, however, be of use in probing other aspects of monoaminergic function and dysfunction in the brain, the latter making important contributions to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and addiction.","dc:creator":"Mooslehner KA","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Mice with very low expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 gene survive into adulthood: potential mouse model for parkinsonism."},"rdfs:label":"viable KO mice model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"To avoid double scoring mice model though this model is vaible comparend to the one described in Wang et al (PMID 9427251) "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5},{"id":"cggv:502e9100-4bae-498c-9fcc-4ce745a5d2ae_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f6b9fb04-19a0-4145-8dcf-0258f93aa1d0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f6b9fb04-19a0-4145-8dcf-0258f93aa1d0","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":16,"allele":{"id":"cggv:fc3298cf-deb3-4b96-94fa-491b755442aa","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003054.6(SLC18A2):c.1160C>T (p.Pro387Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA378513318"}},"detectionMethod":"1.

By mid-childhood they had made little developmental progress and remained severely hypotonic and bradykinetic. They developed epilepsy and had problems with autonomic dysfunction and oculogyric crises. They had a number of orthopaedic problems secondary to their hypotonia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurotransmitters were initially normal, apart from mildly elevated 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid, and the children did not respond favourably to a trial of levodopa-carbidopa. The youngest died from respiratory complications at 10 years of age. Repeat CSF neurotransmitters in the older sibling at eight years of age showed slightly low homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel mutation homozygous in both children in the monoamine transporter gene SLC18A2 (p.Pro237His), resulting in brain dopamine-serotonin vesicular transport disease. This is the second family to be described with a mutation in this gene. Treatment with the dopamine agonist pramipexole in the surviving child resulted in mild improvements in alertness, communication, and eye movements. This case supports the identification of the causal mutation in the original case, expands the clinical phenotype of brain dopamine-serotonin vesicular transport disease and confirms that pramipexole treatment may lead to symptomatic improvement in affected individuals.","dc:creator":"Jacobsen JC","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Brain dopamine-serotonin vesicular transport disease presenting as a

SLC18A2 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive brain dopamine-serotonin vesicular transport disease in 2013 (Rilstone et al., PMID: 23363473). The affected individuals typically present global developmental delay and cognitive impairment, hypotonia, dystonia and Parkinsonism, oculogyric crisis, temperature dysregulation, excessive sweating, hypersalivation, and gastrointestinal dysmotility with inter- and intra-familial variability. Twenty-two unique variants, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift variants, have been reported in 25 affected individuals in 9 publications (PMIDs: 23363473, 31240161, 28716265, 26497564, 29450879, 26539891, 36318270, 31618753, 3871642) and are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence. Overexpression of SLC18A2 Pro387Leu mutant in COS-7 cells dramatically decreased monoamine uptake without affecting protein glycosylation (PMID: 23363473). Platelets derived from the patient with SLC18A2 Pro316Ala alteration showed significantly lower serotonin levels, abnormal morphology, and reduced aggregation response in comparison to the heterozygous carriers and controls (PMID: 31240161). Homozygous knockout (KO) mice exhibited various symptoms including  small size, poor suckling, hypoactivity, motor coordination issues, and neonatal death (PMID: 9427250, 9427251, 11463816).  Additionally, a transgenic mouse line expressing ~5% normal VMAT2 levels [low expressor VMAT2 LO] led to age-dependent reduction in dopamine content and uptake in brain, abnormal locomotor skills and neuronal degeneration similar to Parkinson disease (PMID: 17652604). These features are consistent with the symptoms presented by patients harboring SLC18A2 variants. SLC18A2-overexpressing mice using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) showed increased vesicular volume, dopamine uptake, content and release, along with increased locomotor activity, and reduced anxiety/depressive behavior (PMID: 24979780). \nIn summary, SLC18A2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive brain dopamine-serotonin vesicular transport disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen IEM GCEP on\nthe meeting date July 26, 2024] (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:502e9100-4bae-498c-9fcc-4ce745a5d2ae"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
