We retrospectively analyzed clinical, immunologic and genetic characteristics of 29 patients from 22 families with AID deficiency. Patients' median age at diagnosis and at last evaluation was 4.9 years (range: 0 to 53) and 14.2 years (range: 2.7 to 63), respectively. Most patients had suffered from recurrent and severe infections, however, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement therapy resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of infections. Lymphoid hyperplasia developed in 22 patients and persisted in 7 at last follow-up. It is striking to note that six patients developed autoimmune or inflammatory disorders including diabetes mellitus, polyarthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, Crohn's disease and chronic uveitis. Fifteen distinct AID mutations were found but there was no significant genotype-phenotype correlation. In conclusion, AID-deficient patients are prone to infections and lymphoid hyperplasia, which may be prevented by early-onset IVIG replacement, but also to autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.","dc:creator":"Quartier P","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Clinical, immunologic and genetic analysis of 29 patients with autosomal recessive hyper-IgM syndrome due to Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase deficiency."}},"rdfs:label":"pt 24"},{"id":"cggv:8a409ce5-6260-491c-899e-e35c3a46a0d3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8a409ce5-6260-491c-899e-e35c3a46a0d3_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"One Turkish patient was reported homozygous for missense variant Phe151Ser."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0386858a-f6bc-4631-afef-73a3a35427e4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0386858a-f6bc-4631-afef-73a3a35427e4","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"cggv:f10e98d2-46a7-4a07-9cf0-ba131840d95e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020661.4(AICDA):c.259T>C (p.Cys87Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA6434462"}},"detectionMethod":"southern blot if needed","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"IgG<0.4, IgA<0.05, IgM=9.35","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003496","obo:HP_0002788","obo:HP_0002716"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Other","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:bb64305e-aa87-4b42-846c-d2b2c3e46bff_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f10e98d2-46a7-4a07-9cf0-ba131840d95e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14962793"},"rdfs:label":"pt 17"},{"id":"cggv:bb64305e-aa87-4b42-846c-d2b2c3e46bff","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bb64305e-aa87-4b42-846c-d2b2c3e46bff_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"One Czech patient was reported homozygous for missense variant Cys87Arg."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:4d1493b7-3477-4148-9241-03880c65ff71_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4d1493b7-3477-4148-9241-03880c65ff71","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:fddbc662-3a04-42ce-8f45-c815c0f83c50","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020661.4(AICDA):c.250T>G (p.Trp84Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA383819148"}},"detectionMethod":"PCR primers were designed to flank each of the five exons of AID and genomic DNA from each patient was  examined  by SSCP.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"SSCP","phenotypeFreeText":"IgM=1384, IgA<7, IgG<30","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003496","obo:HP_0002090"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:f1b911fc-1ae2-4ea6-a19f-253aba9c5181_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:fddbc662-3a04-42ce-8f45-c815c0f83c50"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11112359","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Recent studies have shown that mutations in a newly described RNA editing enzyme, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), can cause an autosomal recessive form of hyper IgM syndrome.

Three different mutations in AID were identified in 18 patients with hyper IgM syndrome, including 14 French Canadians, 2 Lumbee Indians, and a brother and sister from Okinawa. No mutations were found in the remaining 32 patients. In the group of patients with hyper IgM syndrome, the patients with mutations in AID were older at the age of diagnosis, were more likely to have positive isohemagglutinins, and were less likely to have anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia. Lymphoid hyperplasia was seen in patients with hyper IgM syndrome and normal AID as well as the patients with hyper IgM syndrome and defects in AID.","dc:creator":"Minegishi

When investigated whether AID mRNAs are induced in splenic B cells by reagents shown to activate B cells and induce CSR, AID mRNAs were strongly upregulated. An immunization with SRBC is known to initiate immunological responses, followed by clonal expansion and germinal center formation, in which CSR and affinity maturation take place. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from spleens of mice immunized with SRBC and subjected to Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 7A). AID mRNA expression was barely detectable in spleens without immunization, and significant up-regulation (3–5-fold induction) was demonstrated 5 and 13 days after immunization. To determine which cells express AID mRNAs in immunized spleen, RT-PCR was performed using fractionated splenic cells. Fig. 7B shows that AID mRNAs were observed in the non-T and CD191 cell fractions, indicating that SRBC immunization induced AID mRNA expression in CD19+ splenic B cells.\n\nBecause the timing of AID mRNA up-regulation in the spleen was roughly synchronous with the onset of GC formation after immunization (Fig. 7A), we next investigated the precise localization of AID mRNAs in lymphoid organs using in situ hybridization. When the antisense AID cRNA was used, distinct focal signals were seen in spleen sections from mice immunized with SRBC for 5 days (Fig. 8, E and H). By contrast, no signals were detected in unimmunized spleen sections with the same probe, in agreement with the data obtained by Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 7A). Peanut agglutinin staining of serial sections (Fig. 8, C, F, and I) showed that both Peyer’s patches and immunized spleens contained GC, and that signals derived from the antisense probe colocalized with GC (Fig. 8, E and H). On the other hand, regardless of immunization, the sense probe produced almost no signal in spleens or Peyer’s patches (Fig. 8, A, D, and G). GCs were rarely observed in spleens from  unimmunized mice (Fig. 8C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that AID mRNAs are specifically induced in GCs, which contain mostly activated B cells after encounter with antigens.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10373455","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We have identified a novel gene referred to as activation-induced deaminase (AID) by subtraction of cDNAs derived from switch-induced and uninduced murine B lymphoma CH12F3-2 cells, more than 80% of which switch exclusively to IgA upon stimulation. The amino acid sequence encoded by AID cDNA is homologous to that of apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 1 (APOBEC-1), a type of cytidine deaminase that constitutes a catalytic subunit for the apoB mRNA-editing complex. In vitro experiments using a glutathione S-transferase AID fusion protein revealed significant cytidine deaminase activity that is blocked by tetrahydrouridine and by zinc chelation. However, AID alone did neither demonstrate activity in C to U editing of apoB mRNA nor bind to AU-rich RNA targets. AID mRNA expression is induced in splenic B cells that were activated in vitro or by immunizations with sheep red blood cells. In situ hybridization of immunized spleen sections revealed the restricted expression of AID mRNA in developing germinal centers in which modulation of immunoglobulin gene information through somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination takes place.

It has been suggested that AID may function as an RNA-editing enzyme or as a cytidine deaminase on DNA. However, the precise enzymatic activity of AID has not been assessed in previous studies. Similarly, although transcription of the target immunoglobulin locus sequences is required for both CSR and somatic hypermutation, the precise role of transcription has remained speculative. Here we use two different assays to demonstrate that AID can deaminate specifically cytidines on single-stranded (ss)DNA but not double-stranded (ds)DNA substrates in vitro. However, dsDNA can be deaminated by AID in vitro when the reaction is coupled to transcription. Moreover, a synthetic dsDNA sequence, which targets CSR in vivo in a manner dependent on transcriptional orientation, was deaminated by AID in vitro with the same transcriptional-orientation-dependence as observed for endogenous CSR. We conclude that transcription targets the DNA deamination activity of AID to dsDNA by generating secondary structures that provide ssDNA substrates.","dc:creator":"Chaudhuri J","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Transcription-targeted DNA deamination by the AID antibody diversification enzyme."},"rdfs:label":"Chaudhuri et al"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:b34c451d-03a1-42dd-a439-599428b0eb38_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:187f991b-26ea-481d-ba51-c5ccfa095317","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d279be2e-b655-4576-9b24-bef858ea05e4","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"defective CSR","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16964591","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID; gene symbol AICDA) is the key molecule required to induce immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) of the variable regions of Ig genes.

The study of natural AID mutants associated with HIGM as well as engineered mutants led to the characterization of the active domains of the protein. AID, through its cytidine deaminase activity, induces a targeted DNA lesion as an early step required for both CSR and SHM. Besides its cytidine deaminase activity, AID plays a further essential role in CSR, likely by recruiting CSR-specific cofactors by its C-terminus. A similar binding of SHM-specific cofactors to the N-terminal part is suggested by the functional characteristics of N(ter) AID artificial mutants. These data require confirmation in vivo. Finally, AID acts as a homo-, di-, or multimeric complex. Together, these data strongly suggest that AID, a master molecule for antibody diversification, exerts its activity on CSR not only as a cytidine deaminase enzyme but also as a docking protein, recruiting specific cofactors to a multimeric complex.","dc:creator":"Durandy A","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase: structure-function relationship as based on the study of mutants."},"rdfs:label":"Durandy 2006"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:b34c451d-03a1-42dd-a439-599428b0eb38_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:209c42e7-e5e5-459a-8202-d74a772eb698","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9b93ae2e-77ba-41dc-aa51-8f015f672ea8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Relative serum antibody levels were similar in mice versus humans.

Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is involved in somatic hypermutation (SHM), gene conversion, and class-switch recombination (CSR) in B-lymphocytes by deaminating C to U during transcription of Ig-variable and Ig-switch region DNA. AID-deficient patients are prone to infections and lymphoid hyperplasia related to giant germinal centers (PMID: 14962793). Additionally, patients with HIGM2 are prone to develop autoimmune diseases; B cells from AID-deficient patients express an abnormal Ig repertoire and high frequencies of autoreactive antibodies, demonstrating that AID is required for the establishment of both central and peripheral B-cell tolerance (PMID: 21700883). The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function (Muramatsu et al, PMID: 10373455). Of note, *AICDA* is also related to autosomal dominant HIGM. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found difference in molecular mechanisms (biallelic loss of function vs. monoallelic dominant negative), inheritance pattern (recessive vs. dominant)  and phenotypic variability (autoimmune disease has only been reported in the recessive form). Therefore, the disease entities have been split and autosomal dominant HIGM has been curated separately.\n\nAt least 41 unique variants (i.e. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, etc.) have been reported in 110 cases of autosomal recessive HIGM (Reviewed in PMID: 22992148). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case level and experimental data. Variants in this gene reported in 13 probands in three publications (PMIDs: 11007475, 14962793 and 11112359) have been included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models (PMIDs: 10373455, 25252954) that recapitulate disease, expression studies (PMIDs: 10373455, 10950930) showing expression specifically in B cells of lymphoid tissues, biochemical function studies (PMID: 12692563), and functional alteration experiments showing defective CSR (PMID: 16964591). In summary, *AICDA* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Hyper-IgM syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been held up over time.
