These tumors are most often sporadic but rarely can be associated with Pallister-Hall syndrome, an autosomal dominant familial syndrome caused by truncation of glioblastoma transcription factor 3, a downstream effector in the sonic hedgehog pathway. In this clinical report, the authors describe two brothers with a different familial syndrome. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report in the literature describing a familial syndrome caused by germline mutations in the Smoothened (SMO) gene and the first familial syndrome associated with hypothalamic hamartomas other than Pallister-Hall syndrome. The authors discuss the endoscopic endonasal biopsy and subtotal resection of a large hypothalamic hamartoma in one of the patients as well as the histopathological findings encountered. Integral to this discussion is the understanding of the hedgehog pathway; therefore, the underpinnings of this pathway and its clinical associations to date are also reviewed.","dc:creator":"Rubino S","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"A familial syndrome of hypothalamic hamartomas, polydactyly, and SMO mutations: a clinical report of 2 cases."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:33566da0-0f61-4dc5-b629-affb4e68e9c7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:33566da0-0f61-4dc5-b629-affb4e68e9c7_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:198c7a6c-d686-4ae5-969b-2a846ddacf18","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:55c11bac-6c77-4a8a-b1ab-2dcb2a7e851d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Le et al. performed qPCR with primers specific to SMO transcript on mRNA extracted from fibroblasts of affected individuals and two unrelated age-matched controls.

A unique feature of the vertebrate Hh pathway is that signal transduction requires the primary cilium (PC) where major pathway components are dynamically enriched. These factors include smoothened (SMO) and patched, which constitute the core reception system for sonic hedgehog (SHH) as well as GLI transcription factors, the key mediators of the pathway. Here, we report bi-allelic loss-of-function variations in SMO in seven individuals from five independent families; these variations cause a wide phenotypic spectrum of developmental anomalies affecting the brain (hypothalamic hamartoma and microcephaly), heart (atrioventricular septal defect), skeleton (postaxial polydactyly, narrow chest, and shortening of long bones), and enteric nervous system (aganglionosis). Cells derived from affected individuals showed normal ciliogenesis but severely altered Hh-signal transduction as a result of either altered PC trafficking or abnormal activation of the pathway downstream of SMO. In addition, Hh-independent GLI2 accumulation at the PC tip in cells from the affected individuals suggests a potential function of SMO in regulating basal ciliary trafficking of GLI2 when the pathway is off. Thus, loss of SMO function results in abnormal PC dynamics of key components of the Hh signaling pathway and leads to a large continuum of malformations in humans.","dc:creator":"Le TL","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Bi-allelic Variations of SMO in Humans Cause a Broad Spectrum of Developmental Anomalies Due to Abnormal Hedgehog Signaling."},"rdfs:label":"Le_Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:5e17a49d-be30-49dd-87ca-ea5d130ec17a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b65c8c1f-9fb4-4938-9e44-aae65597a6bb","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0935"},"dc:description":"When Shh binds to Ptch and activates Smo, Smo converts Gli3R into an activated form (Gli3A).

Most of the brain tumors are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs, consequently, they have a poor prognosis. So, a better knowledge of the Shh pathway opens an opportunity for targeted therapies against brain tumors considering a multi-factorial molecular overview. Therefore, emerging studies are being conducted in order to find new inhibitors for Shh signaling pathway, which could be safely used in clinical trials. Shh can signal through a canonical and non-canonical way, and it also has important points of interaction with other pathways during brain tumorigenesis. So, a better knowledge of Shh signaling pathway opens an avenue of possibilities for the treatment of not only for brain tumors but also for other types of cancers.

SMO was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Pallister-Hall-like syndrome in 2018 by Rubino et al. (PMID: 30497210). Pallister-Hall-like syndrome is a pleiotropic disorder characterized by postaxial polydactyly, hypothalamic hamartoma, cardiac and skeletal anomalies, craniofacial dysmorphisms, and language delay. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformations GCEP found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability between the disease assertions. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, Curry-Jones syndrome (OMIM:601707) and Pallister-Hall-like syndrome (OMIM:241800). The split curation for Curry-Jones syndrome has been curated separately by the Craniofacial Malformations GCEP. Here, the Syndromic Disorders GCEP has curated the relationship between SMO and Pallister-Hall-like syndrome. Seven variants (5 missense, 1 nonsense, and 1 splicing variants) that have been reported in five probands in two publications (PMIDs: 32413283, 35034092) are included in this curation. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression, protein-protein interactions, biochemical function, and animal model evidence (PMIDs: 29558958, 11440720, 27801979, 29571613, 32413283). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date October 20th, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:33566da0-0f61-4dc5-b629-affb4e68e9c7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
