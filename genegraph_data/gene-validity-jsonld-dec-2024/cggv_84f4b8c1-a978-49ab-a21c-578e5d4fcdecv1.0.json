To date most of the pathogenic mutations for Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis have been confined to single population except for R362C mutation which was reported from the Netherlands and the USA (Black).

Clinically, a multitude of neurological, skeletal, and vascular manifestations are usually present. Premature atherosclerosis has been reported in CTX and may be related to the metabolic derangement caused by the deficiency of the enzyme. A CYP27 nonsense mutation created by the deletion of cytosine376 has been identified in four Israeli Druze CTX patients residing in the same village. Molecular screening for this mutation in families of two probands revealed a total of 10 homozygotes and 28 heterozygotes whose clinical and biochemical characteristics are described. Overall, except for tendon xanthomas, most of the clinical manifestations progress with age. The CYP27 mutation was associated with modest differences in the levels of plasma total cholesterol (TC) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). The distribution of plasma concentrations of TC and LDL-C in the CTX families was consistent with a polygenic model. A similar model that includes also the effects of the CYP27 genotypes was not better supported by the data. It may be concluded that, in CTX, the presence of a CYP27 mutation does not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins. Therefore, the reported increased prevalence of atherosclerosis in this disease must be related to other factors.","dc:creator":"Leitersdorf E","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in the Israeli Druze: molecular genetics and phenotypic characteristics."}},"rdfs:label":"Leitersdorf 1994: 221 V-5"},{"id":"cggv:680e636d-2fdc-4d9a-b417-4d4457fa4841","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:680e636d-2fdc-4d9a-b417-4d4457fa4841_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Per ClinGen NDWG scoring guidelines, proband scores are capped at 2."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:4789f016-18a6-4243-b1a2-7c75462c39fd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4789f016-18a6-4243-b1a2-7c75462c39fd","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":34,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:d5e2dfa8-e63c-41cf-b0ea-5c0632f970a5"},{"id":"cggv:e25e416b-b422-4f3f-9630-395af8fc4a8f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000784.4(CYP27A1):c.379C>T (p.Arg127Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA345193"}}],"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001271","obo:HP_0002313","obo:HP_0010874","obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0100321","obo:HP_0001118"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"SSCP","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:36b8a3b4-bed5-442f-984e-cc89a4be58ad_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:e25e416b-b422-4f3f-9630-395af8fc4a8f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31706903"},{"id":"cggv:abc4ba3e-5aab-4f7c-ac17-d8487395d39f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d5e2dfa8-e63c-41cf-b0ea-5c0632f970a5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31706903"}],"rdfs:label":"Lee 2019 IV - 1"},{"id":"cggv:abc4ba3e-5aab-4f7c-ac17-d8487395d39f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:abc4ba3e-5aab-4f7c-ac17-d8487395d39f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:36b8a3b4-bed5-442f-984e-cc89a4be58ad","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:36b8a3b4-bed5-442f-984e-cc89a4be58ad_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0c09c8bc-df73-4695-9740-03dcc434f62d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0c09c8bc-df73-4695-9740-03dcc434f62d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"cggv:7d5ddded-bd94-40de-84f7-998693c1b298","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000784.4(CYP27A1):c.1184+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA345161"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0001118","obo:HP_0010874","obo:HP_0010219","obo:HP_0002028","obo:HP_0002313"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:06e72c88-785e-44c6-8bea-599012d68b91_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7d5ddded-bd94-40de-84f7-998693c1b298"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33400472","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare congenital lipid-storage disorder, leading to a progressive multisystem disease.

More than 300 patients with CTX have been reported to date worldwide and about 50 different mutations identified in the CYP27A1 gene. Almost all mutations lead to the absence or inactive form of the sterol 27-hydroxylase. In this review, according with the aims of this section of the journal, we describe the different pathogenetic mutations in the CYP27A1 gene and the main clinical and pathogenetic aspects that may help clinical neurologists in the diagnosis of CTX.","dc:creator":"Gallus GN","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Clinical and molecular diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with a review of the mutations in the CYP27A1 gene."},"rdfs:label":"Gallus 2006: Biochemical function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9055,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":12.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:33d8313f-da9c-4760-a949-81af42407a5b","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0008948","gene":"hgnc:2605","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The CYP27A1 gene encodes sterol 27-hydroxylase, an enzyme that is part of the bile acid biosynthesis pathway, specifically involved in the metabolism of cholesterol and bile acids. CYP27A1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) in 1991 (Cali et al. PMID: 2019602). CTX is a lipid storage disease clinically characterized by diarrhea in infancy, cataracts onset in childhood, tendon xanthomas appearing in adolescence or early adulthood, and adult-onset progressive neurologic dysfunction (psychiatric symptoms, dementia, pyramidal and/or cerebellar signs, dystonia, atypical parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, and seizures). Brain MRI findings include white matter signal abnormalities, diffuse brain and cerebellar atrophy, and bilateral hyperintensity of the dentate nuclei. CTX is biochemically characterized by severely reduced levels of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol in tissues, and increased excretion of bile acids in urine. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the single disease entity has been maintained: cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (OMIM#606530). \n\nThis curation included one missense, three frameshift, one nonsense, and three splice variants reported in eight probands across five publications (PMIDs:7977352, 33400472, 7860076, 31706903, 26937392). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical function evidence (PMID: 16816916).\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between CYP27A1 and autosomal recessive cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
