The dysregulation of the RAS/MAPK pathway appears to be a common molecular pathogenesis of these disorders: mutations in PTPN11, KRAS, and SOS1 have been identified in patients with NS, those in KRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1, and MAP2K2 in patients with CFC syndrome, and those in HRAS mutations in Costello syndrome patients. Recently, mutations in RAF1 have been also identified in patients with NS and two patients with LEOPARD (multiple lentigines, electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary stenosis, abnormal genitalia, retardation of growth, and sensorineural deafness) syndrome. In the current study, we identified eight RAF1 mutations in 18 of 119 patients with NS and related conditions without mutations in known genes. We summarized clinical manifestations in patients with RAF1 mutations as well as those in NS patients withPTPN11, SOS1, or KRAS mutations previously reported. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and short stature were found to be more frequently observed in patients with RAF1 mutations. Mutations in RAF1 were clustered in the conserved region 2 (CR2) domain, which carries an inhibitory phosphorylation site (serine at position 259; S259). Functional studies revealed that the RAF1 mutants located in the CR2 domain resulted in the decreased phosphorylation of S259, and that mutant RAF1 then dissociated from 14-3-3, leading to a partial ERK activation. Our results suggest that the dephosphorylation of S259 is the primary pathogenic mechanism in the activation of RAF1 mutants located in the CR2 domain as well as of downstream ERK.","dc:creator":"Kobayashi T","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Molecular and clinical analysis of RAF1 in Noonan syndrome and related disorders: dephosphorylation of serine 259 as the essential mechanism for mutant activation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20052757","rdfs:label":"NS209-France"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The paper says that they were not able to reevaluate the 2 patients with Costello syndrome.

The authors state that they did not receive detailed clinical manifestations for one patient with a p.P261L variant of unknown origin and significance. The other case had a de novo p.N262K variant, but the patient died at 1 month of age and was not phenotyped directly by the authors. Both variants, p.P261L and p.N262K, were functionally assessed; however, due to lack of clinical manifestations obtained for these patients, this association is classified as Disputed. The HRAS gene is believed to be the only gene associated with CS (Aoki et al., 2005; Estep, Tidyman, Teitell, Cotter, & Rauen, 2006; Gripp et al., 2006; Kerr et al., 2006; Zampino et al., 2007). Of note, RAF1 is also classified as Definitive in association with Noonan syndrome (NS), Limited in association with NS with multiple lentigines, and as Disputed in association with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating RAF1 with NS-like disorder with loose anagen hair.
