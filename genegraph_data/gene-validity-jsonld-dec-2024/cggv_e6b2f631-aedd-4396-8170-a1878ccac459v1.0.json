We inactivated Bscl2 in mice to examine the mechanisms whereby absence of Bscl2 leads to adipose tissue loss and metabolic disorders. Bscl2(-/-) mice develop severe lipodystrophy of white adipose tissue (WAT), dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. In vitro differentiation of both Bscl2(-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and stromal vascular cells (SVCs) reveals normal early-phase adipocyte differentiation but a striking failure in terminal differentiation due to unbridled cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)-activated lipolysis, which leads to loss of lipid droplets and silencing of the expression of adipose tissue-specific transcription factors. Importantly, such defects in differentiation can be largely rescued by inhibitors of lipolysis but not by a gamma peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) agonist. The residual epididymal WAT (EWAT) in Bscl2(-/-) mice displays enhanced lipolysis. It also assumes a \"brown-like\" phenotype with marked upregulation of UCP1 and other brown adipose tissue-specific markers. Together with decreased Pref1 but increased C/EBPβ levels, these changes highlight a possible increase in cAMP signaling that impairs terminal adipocyte differentiation in the EWAT of Bscl2(-/-) mice. Our study underscores the fundamental role of regulated cAMP/PKA-mediated lipolysis in adipose differentiation and identifies Bscl2 as a novel cell-autonomous determinant of activated lipolysis essential for terminal adipocyte differentiation.","dc:creator":"Chen W","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Berardinelli-seip congenital lipodystrophy 2/seipin is a cell-autonomous regulator of lipolysis essential for adipocyte differentiation."},"rdfs:label":"Non-human model organism"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:48f924d1-1868-404f-b211-d302ffcfe13d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bae5e918-0aa7-41ee-a2ce-0500eeed4439","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Consistent with the human BSCL2 phenotype, Bscl2−/− mice exhibit seipin deficiency, with severe generalized lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, diabetes, and hepatic steatosis phenotypes, significantly lower circulating leptin and adiponectin levels.

Several studies have demonstrated a correlation between neoplasms and hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, which are often associated with a higher risk for and/or aggressiveness of the neoplasm. Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) with autosomal recessive inheritance is a rare disease and is characterized by the lack of adipose tissue, severe insulin resistance, and early metabolic disturbances. Here, we reported a rare case of a type 2 CGL in a girl who presented with a papillary TC (PTC) at the age of 7 years. She had no family history of TC or previous exposure to ionizing radiation. She had a generalized lack of subcutaneous fat, including the palmar and plantar regions, muscle hypertrophy, intense acanthosis nigricans, hepatomegaly, hypertriglyceridemia, severe insulin resistance, and hypoleptinemia. A genetic analysis revealed a mutation in the BSCL2 gene (p.Thr109Asnfs* 5). Ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic solid nodule measuring 1.8 × 1.0 × 1.0 cm, and fine needle aspiration biopsy suggested malignancy. Total thyroidectomy was performed, and a histopathological examination confirmed PTC with vascular invasion and parathyroid lymph node metastasis (pT3N1Mx stage). This is the first report to describe a case of differentiated TC in a child with CGL. Severe insulin resistance that is generally observed in patients with CGL early in life, especially in those with type 2 CGL, may be associated with this uncommon presentation of aggressive PTC during childhood.","dc:creator":"Lima GEDCP","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Aggressive papillary thyroid carcinoma in a child with type 2 congenital generalized lipodystrophy."}},"rdfs:label":"Lima Case"},{"id":"cggv:84fd0f11-1ae4-4540-af52-f89903edce26","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:84fd0f11-1ae4-4540-af52-f89903edce26_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1f619f2e-575d-46f4-96c9-f9c9443ed35a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1f619f2e-575d-46f4-96c9-f9c9443ed35a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":12,"allele":{"id":"cggv:3b75409a-bf04-4d56-bbad-c3311b290fda"},"detectionMethod":"Sanger sequencing of the entire coding region of the BSCL2 gene was performed","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0008887","obo:HP_0003077","obo:HP_0000819","obo:HP_0002240"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:4d8e502e-def3-4d84-8fb1-07ab5944e4cd_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3b75409a-bf04-4d56-bbad-c3311b290fda"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35351089","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by near total absence of adipose tissue along with metabolic complications.

We have curated the inheritance pattern for *BSCL2*- related lipodystrophy as autosomal recessive mode of inheritance because, a recessive mode of inheritance has consistently been reported (PMIDs: Jin et al, 18057387, Costa-Riquetto et al, 34033296)\n\nBi-allelic loss-of-function variants, including nonsense, splice site, frame shift and small deletions in the *BSCL2* gene have been reported in individuals with near- complete absence of adipose tissue, extreme insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, early onset of diabetes, often mild intellectual disability, and in very rare cases, inherited neurological involvement (Celia’s encephalopathy/progressive encephalopathy [PELD], which can also be found in the absence of CGL and is usually caused by variants causing loss of exon 7) (PMIDs: 33916074, 34033296, 29478747, 27144933). Heterozygosity for certain BSCL2 variants believed to cause misfolding of seipin has been implicated in autosomal dominant neurological disorders including Silver spastic paraplegia and distal hereditary motor neuropathy, which do not appear to affect fat metabolism or distribution (PMID:16427281,14981520,18612770).\n\nAt least 30 pathogenic variants (primarily frameshift, nonsense or splice site) in the *BSCL2* gene have been reported in humans with CGL2.   Variants in this gene have been curated in at least 7 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 23430896, 18057387, 35351089, 30266686, 30864635, 23659685), with cases presenting as CGL2. More evidence is available to support the gene-disease association in the literature, but as the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached this has not been curated exhaustively. This gene-disease relationship is supported by multiple knockout mouse models that exhibit a similar phenotype and cellular studies on its role in lipid droplet formation (PMID:23989774,18458148,23680914,22269949). Total points for the experimental evidence are 5. The total score for genetic and experimental evidence together are 17.\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern, mutational mechanism, and phenotype for variants causing congenital generalized lipodystrophy vs. those causing primary neurological conditions. Therefore, we curated *BSCL2* as a lumped curation for autosomal recessive congenital generalized lipodystrophy (OMIM: 269700) and progressive encephalopathy with or without lipodystrophy (OMIM 615924). Autosomal dominant neurological conditions including Silver spastic paraplegia syndrome (OMIM: 270685) and distal hereditary motor neuropathy (OMIM: 619112) will be curated separately in split curations.  \n\nIn summary, *BSCL2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive congenital generalized lipodystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Monogenic Diabetes GCEP on November 13, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e6b2f631-aedd-4396-8170-a1878ccac459"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
