The mitochondrial pool is maintained by either import of cytosolic dNTPs through dedicated transporters or by salvaging deoxynucleosides within the mitochondria; apparently, enzymes of the de novo dNTP synthesis pathway are not present in the mitochondria. In non-replicating cells, where cytosolic dNTP synthesis is down-regulated, mtDNA synthesis depends solely on the mitochondrial salvage pathway enzymes, the deoxyribonucleosides kinases. Two of the four human deoxyribonucleoside kinases, deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) and thymidine kinase-2 (TK2), are expressed in mitochondria. Human dGK efficiently phosphorylates deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine, whereas TK2 phosphorylates deoxythymidine, deoxycytidine and deoxyuridine. Here we identify two mutations in TK2, histidine 90 to asparagine and isoleucine 181 to asparagine, in four individuals who developed devastating myopathy and depletion of muscular mitochondrial DNA in infancy. In these individuals, the activity of TK2 in muscle mitochondria is reduced to 14-45% of the mean value in healthy control individuals. Mutations in TK2 represent a new etiology for mitochondrial DNA depletion, underscoring the importance of the mitochondrial dNTP pool in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial depletion.","dc:creator":"Saada A","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Mutant mitochondrial thymidine kinase in mitochondrial DNA depletion myopathy."}},"rdfs:label":"1"},{"id":"cggv:d789c07b-a41b-4428-ab72-6dea3c3bf5c5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d789c07b-a41b-4428-ab72-6dea3c3bf5c5_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d789c07b-a41b-4428-ab72-6dea3c3bf5c5_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"In muscle mitochondria, the activity of the variant TK2 with deoxythymidine (dThd) as the substrate was reduced to 45%, of the mean control value in patients 1.With deoxycytidine (dCyt) as the substrate, the activity of TK2 was reduced to 32% in patient 1."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:d9448e3b-1a67-45a1-af46-9d949bc881b9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d9448e3b-1a67-45a1-af46-9d949bc881b9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:08213b44-b645-40e3-ad08-3af32b786728"},{"id":"cggv:aef8a93c-509e-413c-9dbf-331531d883ba","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004614.5(TK2):c.144_145del (p.Lys50fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/972912"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:bdd1a27c-15a4-4565-a522-f90ae90f291f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:aef8a93c-509e-413c-9dbf-331531d883ba"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29602790","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Thymine kinase 2 (TK2) is a mitochondrial matrix protein encoded in nuclear DNA and phosphorylates the pyrimidine nucleosides: thymidine and deoxycytidine.

disorders have been published previously, some focusing on pathomechanisms, others on clinical manifestations, while yet another attempted a simplified approach of a comprehensive nosology. Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"mtDNA maintenance"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Many other gene products with similar function."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:0f1bc80d-2f35-4e45-ba17-a2ba34ee51de_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d6e8810-5394-4f6f-86ca-226467d9d863","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f6e5b219-cfe1-4532-b12b-ef99edad682c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The two point mutations affected the Km values for all three types of substrate; dThd, dCyd, and ATP/MgCl2.

Deficiencies in TK2 or dGK activity, due to genetic alteration, have been shown to cause tissue-specific depletion of mtDNA. In the case of TK2 deficiency, affected individuals suffer severe myopathy and, in the case of dGK deficiency, devastating liver or multi-systemic disease. Here, we report clinical and biochemical findings from two patients with mtDNA depletion syndrome. Patient A was a compound heterozygote carrying the previously reported T77M mutation and a novel mutation (R161K) in the TK2 gene. Patient B carried a novel mutation (L250S) in the dGK gene. The clinical symptoms of patient A included muscular weakness and exercise intolerance due to a severe mitochondrial myopathy associated with a 92% reduction in mtDNA. There was minimal involvement of other organs. Patient B suffered from rapidly progressive, early onset fatal liver failure associated with profoundly decreased mtDNA levels in liver and, to a lesser extent, in skeletal muscle. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the mutations detected in patients A and B into the TK2 and dGK cDNAs, respectively. We then characterized each of these recombinant enzymes. Catalytic activities of the three mutant enzymes were reduced to about 2-4% for TK2 and 0.5% for dGK as compared to the wild-type enzymes. Altered competition between dCyd and dThd was observed for the T77M mutant. The residual activities of the two mitochondrial enzymes correlated directly with disease development.","dc:creator":"Wang L","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Molecular insight into mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome in two patients with novel mutations in the deoxyguanosine kinase and thymidine kinase 2 genes."},"rdfs:label":"Enzyme activity using recombinant DNA"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0f1bc80d-2f35-4e45-ba17-a2ba34ee51de_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:27af9c4a-dc3c-411c-9276-0089cf16fd2e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3a8290b7-44fb-43fe-bc64-fb0be4ce29cc","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Despite appearing normal at birth, the TK2âˆ’/âˆ’ mice rapidly display an ataxic phenotype after 10â€“12 days of life, with severely impaired motor coordination and gait, and abnormal limb-clasping reflexes indicative of an underlying neuropathology.

These clinically heterogeneous disorders are characterized by severe reduction in mtDNA copy number in affected tissues and are associated with progressive myopathy, hepatopathy and/or encephalopathy, depending in part on the underlying nuclear genetic defect. Mutations of TK2 have previously been associated with an isolated myopathic form of MDS (OMIM 609560). However, more recently, neurological phenotypes have been demonstrated in patients carrying TK2 mutations, thus suggesting that loss of TK2 results in neuronal dysfunction. Here, we directly address the role of TK2 in neuronal homeostasis using a knockout mouse model. We demonstrate that in vivo loss of TK2 activity leads to a severe ataxic phenotype, accompanied by reduced mtDNA copy number and decreased steady-state levels of electron transport chain proteins in the brain. In TK2-deficient cerebellar neurons, these abnormalities are associated with impaired mitochondrial bioenergetic function, aberrant mitochondrial ultrastructure and degeneration of selected neuronal types. Overall, our findings demonstrate that TK2 deficiency leads to neuronal dysfunction in vivo, and have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of neurological impairment in MDS.","dc:creator":"Bartesaghi S","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Loss of thymidine kinase 2 alters neuronal bioenergetics and leads to neurodegeneration."},"rdfs:label":"TK2 knockout mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:9dc610b5-e379-46a9-a303-1172ec67ab9c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2ac8d48b-d525-4bd4-a008-09406f153947","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Severe TK2 deficiency, followed by myopathy.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18467430","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (MDS), an autosomal recessive condition, is characterized by variable organ involvement with decreased mtDNA copy number and activities of respiratory chain enzymes in affected tissues.

The *TK2* gene encodes mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2, a mitochondrial deoxyribonucleoside kinase that phosphorylates thymidine, deoxycytidine, and deoxyuridine. Defects of this protein lead to impaired synthesis of mtDNA precursors leading to mtDNA depletion.\n\nThe *TK2* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2001 (PMID 11687801), in individuals with infantile onset severe myopathy. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *TK2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *TK2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 11 unique variants (six missense, two frameshift, three stop-gained variants) from three publications (PMIDs: 11687801, 16908738, 29602790) although there are over 100 cases reported in the medical literature. Age of onset varies from infancy to adulthood and outcomes range from death in infancy to being alive in adulthood at the time of report. Features seen in affected individuals include myopathy (muscle weakness that leads to respiratory failure in some), seizures, dysarthria, dysphagia, respiratory insufficiency, ophthalmoplegia, and sensorineural hearing loss. Muscle biopsies show mitochondrial DNA depletion and combined mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme deficiencies. The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by its known biochemical function, knockout mouse model, and knock-in mouse model with a variant found in a patient showing ataxic, progressive muscle weakness and TK2 deficiency phenotype (PMIDs: 33340416, 15639197, 18467430, 20123860). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 6, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0f1bc80d-2f35-4e45-ba17-a2ba34ee51de"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
