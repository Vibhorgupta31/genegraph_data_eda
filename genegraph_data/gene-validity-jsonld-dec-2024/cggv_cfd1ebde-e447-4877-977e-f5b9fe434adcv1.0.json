All three patients had higher BCKDH activity than did those with the classical phenotype. In the first patient, a single base substitution from A to G in intron 8 created a new 5' splice site and caused an insertion of 126 nucleotides between exons 8 and 9 by activating an upstream cryptic 3' splice site in the same intron. The predicted mRNA encoded a truncated protein with 282 amino acids including 4 novel ones at the carboxyl terminus, compared with the normal protein with 421 amino acids. In vitro, the region from the patient but not from a normal control was recognized and was recovered as a novel exon, indicating that the single substitution was responsible for incorporation of the region into mRNA. This mutation probably supports an exon definition model in which the spliceosome recognizes a 3' splice site and then scans downstream for an acceptable 5' splice site, thereby defining an exon. The second patient was homozygous for a G to T transversion at nucleotide 1463 in exon 11, which predicted a substitution of the termination codon by a leucine residue and the addition of 7 extra amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. For each mutation, these two patients were homozygous and their parents were heterozygous. The third patient was a compound heterozygote for a C to G transversion at nucleotide 309 in exon 4 and a G to A transition at nucleotide 1165 in exon 9, causing an Ile-to-Met substitution at amino acid 37 and a Gly-to-Ser substitution at amino acid 323, respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that the molecular basis of intermittent phenotype MSUD in some patients can be due to mutations in the E2 gene, giving rise to a low but significant residual activity of the BCKDH complex.","dc:creator":"Tsuruta M","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Molecular basis of intermittent maple syrup urine disease: novel mutations in the E2 gene of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9621512","rdfs:label":"KM24"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"The variant adds 7 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the protein.

The disorder varies in severity and the clinical spectrum is quite broad with five recognized clinical variants that have no known association with genotype. The classic presentation occurs in the neonatal period with developmental delay, failure to thrive, feeding difficulties, and maple syrup odor in the cerumen and urine, and can lead to irreversible neurological complications, including stereotypical movements, metabolic decompensation, and death if left untreated. Treatment consists of dietary restriction of BCAAs and close metabolic monitoring. Clinical outcomes are generally good in patients where treatment is initiated early. Newborn screening for MSUD is now commonplace in the United States and is included on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP).

A variety of genetic changes may produce this phenotype by affecting the function of any of the three complex-specific subunits. The varied clinical expression observed in patients may be partially explained by the defects in the involved subunit. Here we report localization of the gene for the branched chain acyltransferase component of the complex to human chromosome 1 and describe a proband who is a compound heterozygote at this locus. One allele, inherited from the father, produces transcripts with 124 nucleotides deleted from the coding region. The deletion is not found in the branched chain acyltransferase gene, implying that the deleted transcripts arise by an error in transcript processing. Cells from the patient's mother contain 50% of the normal amount of mRNA for the subunit, and the proband has inherited this nonexpressing allele from her. As a result, the proband produces no acyltransferase protein and therefore has greatly impaired complex activity. A phenotypically normal sibling is shown to be genetically similar to the mother having inherited the mother's nonexpressing allele and the father's normal allele.","dc:creator":"Herring WJ","dc:date":"1991","dc:title":"Molecular genetic basis of maple syrup urine disease in a family with two defective alleles for branched chain acyltransferase and localization of the gene to human chromosome 1."},"rdfs:label":"BCKD Activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Lymphoblasts from an MSUD proband and heterozygous parents.

Here, we show that zebrafish quetschkommode (que) mutant larvae exhibit a progressive locomotor defect that culminates in unusual nose-to-tail compressions and an inability to swim. Correspondingly, extracellular peripheral nerve recordings show that que mutants demonstrate abnormal locomotor output to the axial muscles used for swimming. Using positional cloning and candidate gene analysis, we reveal that a point mutation disrupts the gene encoding dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase E2 (Dbt), a component of a mitochondrial enzyme complex, to generate the que phenotype. In humans, mutation of the DBT gene causes maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), a disorder of branched-chain amino acid metabolism that can result in mental retardation, severe dystonia, profound neurological damage and death. que mutants harbor abnormal amino acid levels, similar to MSUD patients and consistent with an error in branched-chain amino acid metabolism. que mutants also contain markedly reduced levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate within the brain and spinal cord, which probably contributes to their abnormal spinal cord locomotor output and aberrant motility behavior, a trait that probably represents severe dystonia in larval zebrafish. Taken together, these data illustrate how defects in branched-chain amino acid metabolism can disrupt nervous system development and/or function, and establish zebrafish que mutants as a model to better understand MSUD.","dc:creator":"Friedrich T","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mutation of zebrafish dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase E2 results in motor dysfunction and models maple syrup urine disease."},"rdfs:label":"Friedrich 2012 Zebrafish Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"A mutagenesis screen identified a strain, que, which exhibit a progressive locomotor defect.

Mutations in the complex disrupt many fundamental metabolic pathways and cause multiple human diseases including maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), autism, and other related neurological disorders. BCKDH may also be required for the synthesis of monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFAs) from BCAAs. The pathology of MSUD has been attributed mainly to BCAA accumulation, but the role of mmBCFA has not been evaluated. Here we show that disrupting BCKDH in Caenorhabditis elegans causes mmBCFA deficiency, in addition to BCAA accumulation. Worms with deficiency in BCKDH function manifest larval arrest and embryonic lethal phenotypes, and mmBCFA supplementation suppressed both without correcting BCAA levels. The majority of developmental defects caused by BCKDH deficiency may thus be attributed to lacking mmBCFAs in worms. Tissue-specific analysis shows that restoration of BCKDH function in multiple tissues can rescue the defects, but is especially effective in neurons. Taken together, we conclude that mmBCFA deficiency is largely responsible for the developmental defects in the worm and conceivably might also be a critical contributor to the pathology of human MSUD.

Variants in DBT were first reported in humans with the disease as early as 1991 (Herring et al., PMID: 1990841). At least 11 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. About 20% of MSUD cases are attributed to variants in this gene (Strauss et al., 2013; PMID: 20301495). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence (18 pts.) has been reached. In summary, DBT is definitively associated with autosomal recessive maple syrup urine disease.
