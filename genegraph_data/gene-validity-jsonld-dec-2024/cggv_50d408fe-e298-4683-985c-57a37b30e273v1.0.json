Mutations in any one of at least six different myosins can lead to human hereditary deafness, but the precise functions of these proteins in the ear are unknown. This study uses a comparative approach to better understand the role of myosins VI and VIIa in vertebrate ears by examining protein distribution for these two myosins in the ears of evolutionarily diverse fishes and the aquatic clawed toad Xenopus laevis. Both myosins are expressed in the inner ears of all species examined in this study. Myo7a localizes to hair cells, particularly the actin-rich hair bundle, in all species studied. Myo6 also localizes to hair cells, but its distribution differs between species and end organs. Myo6 is found in hair bundles of most fish and frog epithelia examined here but not in anterior and posterior utricular hair bundles of American shad. These results show that myo7a distribution is highly conserved in diverse vertebrates and suggest functional conservation as well. The finding of myo6 in fish and Xenopus hair bundles, however, suggests a novel role for this protein in anamniotic hair cells. The lack of myo6 in specific American shad utricular hair bundles indicates a unique quality of these cells among fishes, perhaps relating to ultrasound detection capability that is found in this species.","dc:creator":"Coffin AB","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Myosin VI and VIIa distribution among inner ear epithelia in diverse fishes."},"rdfs:label":"Coffin Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:31de5d4f-d8d7-452c-af31-a02568648c2c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8ad0e443-842a-4e7c-b4b4-609021ba1770","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"MYO6 binds OTOF.

In this study, exome sequencing was applied to investigate a large Chinese family segregating ADNSHL in which we initially failed to find strong evidence of linkage to any locus by whole-genome linkage analysis. Two affected family members were selected for sequencing. We identified two novel mutations disrupting known ADNSHL genes and shared by the sequenced samples: c.328C>A in COCH (DFNA9) resulting in a p.Q110K substitution and a deletion c. 2814_2815delAA in MYO6 (DFNA22) causing a frameshift alteration p.R939Tfs*2. The pathogenicity of novel coding variants in ADNSHL genes was carefully evaluated by analysis of co-segregation with phenotype in the pedigree and in light of established genotype-phenotype correlations. The frameshift deletion in MYO6 was confirmed as the causative variant for this pedigree, whereas the missense mutation in COCH had no clinical significance. The results allowed us to retrospectively identify the phenocopy in one patient that contributed to the negative finding in the linkage scan.

This association was made using case-level data only. At least 7 missense, nonsense and frameshift variants have been reported in humans. Loss-of-function variants cause autosomal dominant progressive hearing loss with variable age of onset (childhood – 30s). Hypomorphic missense variants likely are only hearing loss-causing when in trans with a second variant. A family reported in Brownstein et al. 2014 (24105371) had in-frame exon 10 deletion and dominant, progressive hearing loss, with one homozygote with profound congenital HL. This supports MYO6 as dose-dependent. MYO6 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2001 (Melchionda et al.). Association is seen in at least 8 probands in 4 publications (11468689, 25999546, 25227905, 18348273). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in >44 additional family members. Three mouse models exist for MYO6, one of which a heterozygote has mild HL. In summary, MYO6 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. Based on literature review, semi-dominance is likely, in which biallelic variants cause more severe hearing loss.
