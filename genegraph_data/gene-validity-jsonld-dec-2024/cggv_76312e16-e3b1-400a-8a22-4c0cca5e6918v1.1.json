Mutations in the gene encoding SEC63 cause polycystic liver disease in humans; however, it is not clear how altered SEC63 influences disease manifestations. In mice, loss of SEC63 induces cyst formation both in liver and kidney as the result of reduced polycystin-1 (PC1). Here we report that inactivation of SEC63 induces an unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway that is protective against cyst formation. Specifically, using murine genetic models, we determined that SEC63 deficiency selectively activates the IRE1α-XBP1 branch of UPR and that SEC63 exists in a complex with PC1. Concomitant inactivation of both SEC63 and XBP1 exacerbated the polycystic kidney phenotype in mice by markedly suppressing cleavage at the G protein-coupled receptor proteolysis site (GPS) in PC1. Enforced expression of spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) enhanced GPS cleavage of PC1 in SEC63-deficient cells, and XBP1 overexpression in vivo ameliorated cystic disease in a murine model with reduced PC1 function that is unrelated to SEC63 inactivation. Collectively, the findings show that SEC63 function regulates IRE1α/XBP1 activation, SEC63 and XBP1 are required for GPS cleavage and maturation of PC1, and activation of XBP1 can protect against polycystic disease in the setting of impaired biogenesis of PC1.

Sec63 is a member of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocon machinery, although it is unclear how mutations in SEC63 lead to liver cyst formation in humans. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a zebrafish sec63 mutant, which was discovered in a screen for mutations that affect the development of myelinated axons. Accordingly, we show that disruption of sec63 in zebrafish leads to abnormalities in myelinating glia in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the vertebrate nervous system, segments of myelin are separated by the nodes of Ranvier, which are unmyelinated regions of axonal membrane containing a high density of voltage-gated sodium channels. We show that sec63 mutants have morphologically abnormal and reduced numbers of clusters of voltage-gated sodium channels in the spinal cord and along peripheral nerves. Additionally, we observed reduced myelination in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as swollen ER in myelinating glia. Markers of ER stress are upregulated in sec63 mutants. Finally, we show that sec63 mutants develop liver pathology. As in glia, the primary defect, detectable at 5 dpf, is fragmentation and swelling of the ER, indicative of accumulation of proteins in the lumen. At 8 dpf, ER swelling is severe; other pathological features include disrupted bile canaliculi, altered cytoplasmic matrix and accumulation of large lysosomes. Together, our analyses of sec63 mutant zebrafish highlight the possible role of ER stress in polycystic liver disease and suggest that these mutants will serve as a model for understanding the pathophysiology of this disease and other abnormalities involving ER stress.","dc:creator":"Monk KR","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutation of sec63 in zebrafish causes defects in myelinated axons and liver pathology."},"rdfs:label":"Zebrafish sec63-st67"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:108121ee-b91a-438f-9b4f-a7bcbbf58626","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d34b51e4-a690-49d8-ae2e-c439dc1f904c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"SEC63KO and DKO mouse models develop kidney cysts similar to the phenotype seen in humans: inactivation of SEC63 results activation of the IRE1α-XBP1 branch of unfolded protein response (UPR), SEC63 exists in a protein interaction complex with PC1, and cleavage of PC1 is dependent on SEC63 and XBP1","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25844898","rdfs:label":"SEC63 KO Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Development of mouse model with cystic kidneys."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:76312e16-e3b1-400a-8a22-4c0cca5e6918_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:76312e16-e3b1-400a-8a22-4c0cca5e6918_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:76312e16-e3b1-400a-8a22-4c0cca5e6918_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:de7ad9ec-b614-4319-8feb-5ea4ef89b8e6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f7a52f72-dc5d-4e1c-bd50-1c65a0712bfc","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"A proband was defined as a patient with at least one affected family member.

ADPLD due to SEC63 mutations (ADPLD-SEC63) is diagnosed in adults with a family history of liver cysts, under age 40 with any number of liver cysts and individuals over the age of 40 with four or more liver cysts. Women are associated with more severe course of disease, and kidney cysts are present in approximately 28-35% of cases, but in these cases the kidney disease is mild with no association with progression to end stage renal disease (PMID 20408995). At least twenty unique variants (e.g. nonsense, frameshift, splice site, missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, population data and experimental data. Summary of Case Level Data: 12 POINTS. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 19 probands and in at least four publications (PMID 15133510, PMID 16835903, PMID 20095989, PMID 28375157). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 24 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is heterozygous loss of function (PMID 15133510, PMID 20095989), with experimental evidence suggesting endoplasmic reticulum stress with induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and association with aberrant polycystin 1 (PC1) post-translational modifications leading to cystogenesis (PMID 22864019, PMID 25844898). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies in cell models, zebrafish models, and mouse models (PMID 21685914, PMID 22864019, PMID 25844898). In summary, SEC63 is definitively associated with AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT POLYCYSTIC LIVER DISEASE. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 09/23/2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:76312e16-e3b1-400a-8a22-4c0cca5e6918"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
