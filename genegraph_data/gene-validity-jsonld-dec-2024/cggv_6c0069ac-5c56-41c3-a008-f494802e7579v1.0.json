The mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex plays a critical role in this process. MICU2 is a major component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex and its deficiency has been shown to impair mitochondrial calcium [Ca2+]m homeostasis although the exact mechanism remains unclear. We used exome sequencing, positional mapping, and functional characterization of MICU2 deficiency to investigate the role of MICU2 in calcium homeostasis. Using combined autozygome/exome analysis, a homozygous truncating mutation in MICU2 was found to fully segregate with a neurodevelopmental disorder in the form of severe cognitive impairment, spasticity, and white matter involvement in a multiplex consanguineous family. Patient-derived MICU2-deficient cells displayed impaired [Ca2+]m homeostasis, with associated increase in mitochondrial sensitivity to oxidative stress, and abnormal regulation of inner mitochondrial membrane potential. This is the first demonstration of MICU2 deficiency in humans, which we suggest causes a distinct neurodevelopmental phenotype secondary to impaired mitochondrial calcium uniporter-mediated regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis.","dc:creator":"Shamseldin HE","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"A null mutation in MICU2 causes abnormal mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and a severe neurodevelopmental disorder."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6c0069ac-5c56-41c3-a008-f494802e7579_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6c0069ac-5c56-41c3-a008-f494802e7579_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:c737845a-0021-44a2-b627-99c5a565675e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c737845a-0021-44a2-b627-99c5a565675e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":11,"allele":{"id":"cggv:0990f635-1138-4838-be75-0e4a4974b65a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152726.3(MICU2):c.42G>A (p.Trp14Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA387503454"}},"detectionMethod":"MICU2: NM_152726: c.42G>A:p.W14*\n\nReported in gnomAD v 2.1.1 at low AF \n0.00001055 (no homozygotes)\nParents confirmed carriers \n","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Brain MRI with gliosis and T2 foci in both cerebral hemisphere in a subcortical distribution","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001249","previousTestingDescription":"Autozygosome testing, microarray negative ","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:1a08f07f-435c-46aa-b368-ae906f66c053_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:0990f635-1138-4838-be75-0e4a4974b65a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29053821"},"rdfs:label":"Shamseldin et al 2017 Patient 16DG0621 "},{"id":"cggv:1a08f07f-435c-46aa-b368-ae906f66c053","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1a08f07f-435c-46aa-b368-ae906f66c053_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:1a08f07f-435c-46aa-b368-ae906f66c053_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RT-PCR does not suggest instability of transcript, but immunoblot revealed complete absence of full protein (1.5-0.5)\n\nUsed bradykinin to increase cytosolic Calcium.

We show here that MICU2 behaves as a pure inhibitor of MCU at low cytosolic [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)]c), though its effects decrease as [Ca(2+)]c is increased and disappear above 7 μM. Regarding MICU1, studying its effects is more difficult because knockdown of MICU1 leads also to loss of MICU2. However, while knockdown of MICU2 induces only a persistent increase in mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, knockdown of MICU1 also induces a peculiar use-dependent transient activation of MCU that cannot be attributed to the parallel loss of MICU2. Therefore, MICU1 is endowed with a specific inhibitory effect on MCU at low [Ca(2+)]c, separate and kinetically different from that of MICU2. On the other hand, we and others have shown previously that MICU1 activates MCU at [Ca(2+)]c above 2.5 μM. Thus, MICU1 has a double role in MCU regulation, inhibitory at low [Ca(2+)]c and activatory at high [Ca(2+)]c.","dc:creator":"Matesanz-Isabel J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Functional roles of MICU1 and MICU2 in mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake."},"rdfs:label":"Calcium Homeostasis Genes in Mitochondria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Score 0.5 points for 1 gene definitively associated with PMD"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:6c0069ac-5c56-41c3-a008-f494802e7579_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:48eff9c0-9efc-4cc4-b84e-c8d8b025853d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:917926f3-77d5-44b6-816e-67da28ea5364","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Abnormal calcium flux similar to Matesan-Isabel et al 2016","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24560927","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondrial calcium accumulation was recently shown to depend on a complex composed of an inner-membrane channel (MCU and MCUb) and regulatory subunits (MICU1, MCUR1, and EMRE). A fundamental property of MCU is low activity at resting cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations, preventing deleterious Ca(2+) cycling and organelle overload. Here we demonstrate that these properties are ensured by a regulatory heterodimer composed of two proteins with opposite effects, MICU1 and MICU2, which, both in purified lipid bilayers and in intact cells, stimulate and inhibit MCU activity, respectively. Both MICU1 and MICU2 are regulated by calcium through their EF-hand domains, thus accounting for the sigmoidal response of MCU to [Ca(2+)] in situ and allowing tight physiological control. At low [Ca(2+)], the dominant effect of MICU2 largely shuts down MCU activity; at higher [Ca(2+)], the stimulatory effect of MICU1 allows the prompt response of mitochondria to Ca(2+) signals generated in the cytoplasm.","dc:creator":"Patron M","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"MICU1 and MICU2 finely tune the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter by exerting opposite effects on MCU activity."},"rdfs:label":"siRNA knockdown of MICU2 in HeLa cells "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"0.5 for abnormal calcium flux studies "},{"id":"cggv:0eb6f211-e897-4fe3-8e34-0110b73378b6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bb85d7ab-9548-4f6e-8e45-371e627104c7","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"silencing of MICU2 induced a very large increase in the mitochondrial [Ca2 +] peak triggered by histamine, an effect which was fully rescued after a 24 h-overexpression of the MICU2 gene (Fig. 1a, statistics in Fig. 1c). \n\nThis effect was due to a primary increase in mitochondrial Ca2 + uptake, because the histamine-induced cytosolic [Ca2 +] peak was in fact notably reduced (Fig. 1b, statistics in Fig. 1e). However, under resting conditions, we could only detect a small but significant increase in [Ca2 +]M in the MICU2-silenced cells, from 71 ± 5 nM to 100 ± 10 nM (mean ± s.e., n = 8, Fig. 1d). Instead, there was no change in the resting [Ca2 +]c levels in the MICU2-silenced cells (Fig. 1e). \n\nperformed follow up studies on mitochondrial Ca2 + uptake in a whole range of cytosolic [Ca2 +].

Fig. 3m shows the ratio among the increase in [Ca2 +]M observed in MICU2-silenced cells and that found in the controls. The ratio starts at about 6-fold and decreases steadily as the [Ca2 +]c increases, reaching values close to unity at 7–10 μM.

This is a subunit of the mitochondrial uniporter complex, a multi-subunit calcium channel of the mitochondrial inner membrane. *MICU2* is involved in calcium import into the mitochondrion and negative regulation of mitochondrial calcium ion concentration by regulating calcium channel opening.  \n\nThe *MICU2* gene has been reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in one case to date in 2017 (PMID: 29053821). This was an 11-year-old girl with cognitive delay and intellectual disability. Brain MRI showed gliosis and T2 hyperintense foci in both cerebral hemisphere in a subcortical distribution. She had a similarly affected brother who also had abnormal eye movements. Although the phenotype is nonspecific, there was a homozygous nonsense variant in *MICU2* present in these two siblings, and given the calcium flux abnormalities noted in patient cells, this GCEP elected to include this family in this curation. While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MICU2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MICU2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. As described above, this curation includes one proband with a homozygous nonsense variant from one publication (PMID: 29053821). \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by the known biochemical function of *MICU2* that is shared with *MICU1*, a gene with a definitive association to primary mitochondrial disease (PMID: 26903221). It is also supported by experimental data including mitochondrial calcium uptake studies with either shRNA or siRNA knockdown in HeLa cells (PMIDs: 26903221, 24560927) and knockout mice (PMID: 29073106). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
