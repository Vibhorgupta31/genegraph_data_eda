Involvement of a disrupted composition of the intercalated disc (ID) has been reported. However, in children, little is established about such subcellular changes during disease, because of the pathological mix-up with the ongoing cardiac maturation. This leaves maladaptive remodeling often undetected. We aimed at illustrating subcellular alterations in children diagnosed with DCM compared to age-matched controls, focusing on ID proteins known to be crucially stable under healthy conditions and destabilized during cardiac injury in adults. Left ventricular or septal pediatric specimens were collected from 7 individuals diagnosed with DCM (age: 23 weeks in utero to 8 weeks postnatal) and age-matched controls that died of non-cardiovascular cause. We determined the amount of fibrosis and localization of ID proteins by immunohistochemistry. In pediatric DCM, most ID proteins follow similar spatiotemporal changes in localization as in controls. However, although no mutations were found, the signal of the desmosomal protein Desmoglein-2 was reduced in all pediatric DCM specimens, but not in controls or adult DCM patients. Endocardial and transmural fibrosis was increased in all pediatric DCM patients compared to age-matched controls. Composition of the ID in pediatric DCM patients is similar to controls, except for the localization of Desmoglein-2 and presence of severe fibrosis. This suggests that the architecture of desmosomes is already disturbed in the early stages of DCM. These findings contribute to the understanding of pediatric DCM.","dc:creator":"Kessler EL","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Disturbed Desmoglein-2 in the intercalated disc of pediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy."},"rdfs:label":"IHC in pediatric post mortem hearts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:53e238ec-c11b-4ced-a505-2593a9e35b20","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b8851f47-6f9c-41b9-ba3b-09db83cf4c58","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"DSG-2 has been shown to interact with DCM genes at the protein level (DSP)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28764973","rdfs:label":"Pediatric DCM Hearts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:a7df1018-593f-481f-9dd0-77ce3ea829a6_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a7df1018-593f-481f-9dd0-77ce3ea829a6_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f1b0aa66-245e-43e1-9c70-0a71af3c617e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f707bf9b-423f-4f53-b2dd-38b9eb3e1e60","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":56,"detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:f1b0aa66-245e-43e1-9c70-0a71af3c617e_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:e178bdce-6964-4f63-8f47-793b32a5bbf1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001943.5(DSG2):c.484del (p.Asp162MetfsTer10)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913188915"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21859740","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most frequent indication for orthotopic heart transplantation.

Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes one published definitive DCM case with truncating variant in DSG2 published by Garcia-Pavia et al (2011, PMID: 21859740). Of note, this person had limited ECG/arrhythmia phenotyping. Multiple other published variants have population frequencies which exclude them from scoring, as they are observed at a frequency higher than would be expected to have a pathogenic effect. In addition, this gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence from postnatal DCM hearts showing reduced DSG2 signal in myocardium and other intercalated disc proteins were normal(Kessler et al, 2017, PMID: 28764973). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of DSG2 with autosomal dominant DCM. .
