Tubular aggregates (TAs) are abnormal structures in the skeletal muscle, and although their mechanism of formation has not been clarified, altered Ca(2+) homeostasis related to a disordered SR is suggested to be one of the main contributing factors. TA myopathy is a hereditary muscle disorder that is pathologically characterized by the presence of TAs. Recently, dominant mutations in the STIM1 gene, encoding a Ca(2+) sensor that controls CRAC channels, have been identified to cause tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM). Here, we identified heterozygous missense mutations in the ORAI1 gene, encoding the CRAC channel itself, in three families affected by dominantly inherited TAM with hypocalcemia. Skeletal myotubes from an affected individual and HEK293 cells expressing mutated ORAI1 proteins displayed spontaneous extracellular Ca(2+) entry into cells without diminishment of luminal Ca(2+) or the association with STIM1.

Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a major mechanism controlling Ca2+ homeostasis, and is mediated by the concerted activity of the Ca2+ sensor STIM1 and the Ca2+ channel ORAI1. Dominant gain-of-function mutations in STIM1 or ORAI1 cause tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM) or Stormorken syndrome, whereas recessive loss-of-function mutations are associated with immunodeficiency. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of novel ORAI1 mutations in TAM patients. We assess basal activity and SOCE of the mutant ORAI1 channels, and we demonstrate that the G98S and V107M mutations generate constitutively permeable ORAI1 channels, whereas T184M alters the channel permeability only in the presence of STIM1. These data indicate a mutation-dependent pathomechanism and a genotype/phenotype correlation, as the ORAI1 mutations associated with the most severe symptoms induce the strongest functional cellular effect. Examination of the non-muscle features of our patients strongly suggests that TAM and Stormorken syndrome are spectra of the same disease. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of SOCE in skeletal muscle physiology, and provide new insights in the pathomechanisms involving aberrant Ca2+ homeostasis and leading to muscle dysfunction.","dc:creator":"Böhm J","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"ORAI1 Mutations with Distinct Channel Gating Defects in Tubular Aggregate Myopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28058752","rdfs:label":"BO5510"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Sufficent phenotypic evidence plus variant-level evidence (T184M mutant ORAI1 HEK293 cells had significantly higher Ca2+ levels particularly after activated SOCE indicating funcitonal alteration) yields default points."},{"id":"cggv:ca34c59a-d9a8-4717-bb11-5ff41c001558_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:525fcf1d-e9b0-447a-a555-b437748f0c70","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":42,"detectionMethod":"Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of the ORAI1 variant following confirmation in the two other families","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003557","obo:HP_0003803","obo:HP_0031237","obo:HP_0003236","obo:HP_0003551","obo:HP_0100301","obo:HP_0030951","obo:HP_0003323","obo:HP_0003202","obo:HP_0003306","obo:HP_0012548","obo:HP_0003324"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Elevated Serum CK 213 IU/L (~37-142)","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:ca34c59a-d9a8-4717-bb11-5ff41c001558_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:b6b9b0e7-dfa1-42bd-8ab5-7c53a2d04abe","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_032790.3(ORAI1):c.412C>T (p.Leu138Phe)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA199188"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25227914"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25227914","rdfs:label":"ENCII-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Sufficent phenotypic evidence combined with variant-level evidence (Under extracellular Ca2+ depletion, HEK-293 cells transfected with mutant Leu138Phe ORAI1 showed a dramatic elevation of Ca2+ levels compared to controls) gives this proband default points."},{"id":"cggv:1634aefd-655b-4327-a927-e9adf16c652e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:963a2907-7c95-4251-bc2c-ee12af2f89c0","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":51,"detectionMethod":"STIM1 and ORAI1 were sequenced and a heterozygous missense mutation in ORAI1 was found that segregated with the disease.","phenotypeFreeText":"Elevated serum CK (900 to 1200 UI/l)","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0003710","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Blood examinations in patients did not reveal any abnormalities besides CK elevation.

All patients had a mild, late onset TAM revealed by asymptomatic creatine kinase (CK) elevation and congenital miosis consistent with a Stormorken-like Syndrome, in the absence of thrombocytopathy. Muscle biopsies showed classical histological findings but ultrastructural analysis revealed atypical tubular aggregates (TAs). The whole body muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a similar pattern of muscle involvement that correlated with clinical severity. The lower limbs were more severely affected than the scapular girdle, and thighs were more affected than legs. Molecular analysis revealed a novel c.290C>G (p.S97C) mutation in ORAI1 in all affected patients. Functional assays in both human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and myotubes showed an increased rate of Ca2+ entry due to a constitutive activation of the CRAC channel, consistent with a 'gain-of-function' mutation.

Loss-of-function mutations in the CRAC channel pore-forming protein ORAI1 or the Ca(2+) sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) result in severe immune dysfunction and nonprogressive myopathy. Here, we identify gain-of-function mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of STIM1 (p.R304W) associated with thrombocytopenia, bleeding diathesis, miosis, and tubular myopathy in patients with Stormorken syndrome, and in ORAI1 (p.P245L), associated with a Stormorken-like syndrome of congenital miosis and tubular aggregate myopathy but without hematological abnormalities. Heterologous expression of STIM1 p.R304W results in constitutive activation of the CRAC channel in vitro, and spontaneous bleeding accompanied by reduced numbers of thrombocytes in zebrafish embryos, recapitulating key aspects of Stormorken syndrome. p.P245L in ORAI1 does not make a constitutively active CRAC channel, but suppresses the slow Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of the CRAC channel, thus also functioning as a gain-of-function mutation. These data expand our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum of dysregulated CRAC channel signaling, advance our knowledge of the molecular function of the CRAC channel, and suggest new therapies aiming at attenuating store-operated Ca(2+) entry in the treatment of patients with Stormorken syndrome and related pathologic conditions.

STIM1-KO and ORAI1-KO cell lines were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in U2OS cells. In both cases, KO cells presented a notable reduction of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) that was rescued by expression of STIM1-mCherry and ORAI1-mCherry. These results demonstrated that SOCE regulates membrane ruffling at the leading edge of cells. Moreover, endogenous ORAI1 and overexpressed ORAI1-GFP co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous CTTN. This latter result, in addition to the KO cells' phenotype, the preservation of ORAI1-CTTN co-localization during ruffling, and the inhibition of membrane ruffling by the Ca2+-channel inhibitor SKF96365, further supports a functional link between SOCE and membrane ruffling.","dc:creator":"Lopez-Guerrero AM","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Regulation of membrane ruffling by polarized STIM1 and ORAI1 in cortactin-rich domains."},"rdfs:label":"ORAI1-KO Cells Demonstrate Impaired SOCE"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This experimental data provides significant evidence to show that ORAI1 is essential for not only proper SOCE pathway activity, but also proper cell membrane ruffling and cell migration.

Variants in this gene have also been reported in association with an Immunodeficiency phenotype, which will be assessed separately. At least 6 missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 24591628, 25227914, 27882542, 28058752). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in a significant number of additional family members via whole exome sequencing. A significant amount of variant-level evidence was available, with each individual variant demonstrating altered SOCE activation and Ca2+ homeostasis.\nThe mechanism for disease is heterozygous gain of function, with alteration of several domains responsible for altered calcium signalling detection and resulting consitutive activation of store-operated calcium entry regardless of the intracellular calcium levels. (Morin et al. 2019, PMID: 31448844) This gene-disease association and mechanism is supported by biochemical function evidence, expression evidence, physical interaction with STIM1, and functional studies demonstrating SOCE loss and rescue via ORAI1 expression. ORAI1's role in SOCE, relationship with STIM1, and the resulting always activated state when the expression and function of the protein is altered show clear correlations with the displayed phenotypes as skeletal muscle signalling relies on calcium flow. Currently there are no available models that properly demonstrate TAM phenotypes, likely due to the necessity of a knock-in model and less research performed than on STIM1.\nIn summary, ORAI1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant tubular aggregate myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bb8d614e-e8ff-4f16-bba3-6fc35ea56e8a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
