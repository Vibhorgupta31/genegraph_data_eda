Recent work has shown that gain-of-function mutations in mechanically activated Piezo1 cation channels are associated with the dehydrating RBC disease xerocytosis, implicating a role of mechanotransduction in RBC volume regulation. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations result in RBC dehydration are unknown. In this study, we show that RBCs exhibit robust calcium entry in response to mechanical stretch and that this entry is dependent on Piezo1 expression. Furthermore, RBCs from blood-cell-specific Piezo1 conditional knockout mice are overhydrated and exhibit increased fragility both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that Yoda1, a chemical activator of Piezo1, causes calcium influx and subsequent dehydration of RBCs via downstream activation of the KCa3.1 Gardos channel, directly implicating Piezo1 signaling in RBC volume control. Therefore, mechanically activated Piezo1 plays an essential role in RBC volume homeostasis.","dc:creator":"Cahalan SM","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Piezo1 links mechanical forces to red blood cell volume."},"rdfs:label":"Expression analysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:89e8456d-f99d-4041-b806-52c9f11a03a5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4e6143f5-603f-4fdb-aec5-959b01882076","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Both loss of function and gain of function of PIEZO1 is associated with DHS.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26001274","rdfs:label":"YODA stimulation of Red Blood Cell "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:51ba3132-d09e-45b1-8118-3d047588a6b6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ffa44ba7-4f71-454f-89a6-09cfec9b373c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Lymphatic dysfunction due to lack of responses to flow.

Time-controlled deletion of Piezo1 using a pan-endothelial Cre driver (Cdh5[PAC]-CreERT2) or lymphatic-specific Cre driver (Prox1-CreERT2) equally inhibited lymphatic valve formation in newborn mice. Furthermore, Piezo1 deletion in adult lymphatics caused substantial lymphatic valve degeneration. Piezo1 knockdown in cultured lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) largely abrogated the OSS-induced upregulation of the lymphatic valve signature genes. Conversely, ectopic Piezo1 overexpression upregulated the lymphatic valve genes in the absence of OSS. Remarkably, activation of Piezo1 using chemical agonist Yoda1 not only accelerated lymphatic valve formation in animals, but also triggered upregulation of some lymphatic valve genes in cultured LECs without exposure to OSS. In summary, our studies together demonstrate that Piezo1 is the force sensor in the mechanotransduction pathway controlling lymphatic valve development and maintenance, and Piezo1 activation is a potentially novel therapeutic strategy for congenital and surgery-associated lymphedema.","dc:creator":"Choi D","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Piezo1 incorporates mechanical force signals into the genetic program that governs lymphatic valve development and maintenance."},"rdfs:label":"Down steam gene induction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Additional paper replicates the same result PMID: 30482854"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:6a86cb1d-4eed-4c10-971f-4a9578cb12b1_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6ab8cc3a-ddf9-491e-a788-c557b7ec73a7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf2a985d-88e7-4ece-b019-b85757389b21","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Upon mechanical stimulation cells with Piezo1 had increased calcium release determined by calcium imaging which is consistent with increased channel activity.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26001275","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Piezo ion channels are activated by various types of mechanical stimuli and function as biological pressure sensors in both vertebrates and invertebrates.

Recently, two missense mutations in the mechanically activated PIEZO1 (FAM38A) ion channel were associated with dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis. However, it is not known how these mutations affect PIEZO1 function. Here, by combining linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing in a large pedigree and Sanger sequencing in two additional kindreds and 11 unrelated dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis cases, we identify three novel missense mutations and one recurrent duplication in PIEZO1, demonstrating that it is the major gene for dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis. All the dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis-associated mutations locate at C-terminal half of PIEZO1. Remarkably, we find that all PIEZO1 mutations give rise to mechanically activated currents that inactivate more slowly than wild-type currents. This gain-of-function PIEZO1 phenotype provides insight that helps to explain the increased permeability of cations in red blood cells of dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis patients.

Interestingly, basal activity of all the mutated channels was not significantly altered at the opposite of what was expected according to the decreased water and cation contents of resting RBC. In addition, the features of mutant PIEZO1 expressed in HEK293 cells do not always correlate with the observation in RBC where PIEZO1 mutations induced a cation leak associated with an increased conductance.

These two disease entities do show significant phenotypic overlap and therefore, these may later be lumped together if evidence permits. The split curation of autosomal recessive lymphatic malformation 6 has been curated separately.\n\nPIEZO1 was found to be associated with dehydrated hereditary stomatocystosis (DHS) in 2013 by Albuisson et al. DHS, also known as Hereditary Xerocytosis (HX), is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by increased permeability of erythrocyte membranes to calcium resulting in subsequent loss of potassium and dehydration. Affected individuals may show mild to moderate compensated hemolytic anemia, pseudohyperkalemia, and blood films may show occasional stomatocytes. Mechanotransduction is also a critical regulator of lymphatic vascular development, and shear stress triggers signaling pathways that promote lymphatic vessel maturation and lymphatic valve formation. Affected individuals with transient perinatal edema or fetal hydrops have been observed in DHS families for many years (PMIDs: 11001917, 23479567, 23695678, 26333996, 28716860, 29673682, 30655378, 33027564, 32109669). Numerous variants have been reported in PIEZO1 in relation to DHS, the majority being missense mutations. The proposed molecular mechanism for PIEZO1 DHS is gain of function as many of the missense variants result in slower channel inactivation or reduced threshold of activation following stimulation of patient red blood cells or cells overexpressing missense variants. However, some missense variants have been shown to have a variety of effects on protein function including response to osmotic stress, membrane trafficking, or transcript and protein stability (PMIDs: 23695678, 28716860, 33478008, 30237269, 29210095, 34737711, 33973227, 26001275, 28619848, 26001274, 30930797). Therefore, the full spectrum of molecular mechanisms has not been fully resolved at this time.\n\nOver 50 unique variants have been reported in individuals with DHS across numerous publications and only missense variants that reach likely pathogenic status based on ACMG criteria have been counted in this curation. Many additional variants of uncertain significance in affected individuals have been reported (Figure 2 PMID 36453701). Several recurrent variants, including the most frequently reported p.Arg2456His and p.L2495_E2496dup, but also p.Val598Met, p.Ala2020Thr, p.Thr2127Met and p.Arg2488 have been noted in at least three published reports in unrelated affected individuals. Segregation in multiple unrelated families has been demonstrated in the literature (including but not limited to PMIDs 23695678, 23581886, 32109669) reaching maximum scoring for segregation.\n\nSubstantial evidence supports this gene-disease relationship including case-level data, segregation, and experimental data that supports altered protein function for a selection of variants. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between PIEZO1 and autosomal dominant dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis with or without pseudohyperkalemia and/or perinatal edema. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
