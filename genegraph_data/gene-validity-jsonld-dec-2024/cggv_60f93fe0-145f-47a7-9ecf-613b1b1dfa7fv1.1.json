Here we describe an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutant mouse, alien (aln), which has abnormal primary cilia and shows overactivation of the SHH pathway. The aln locus encodes a novel protein, THM1 (tetratricopeptide repeat-containing hedgehog modulator-1), which localizes to cilia. aln-mutant cilia have bulb-like structures at their tips in which IFT proteins (such as IFT88) are sequestered, characteristic of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Caenorhabditis elegans retrograde IFT mutants. RNA-interference knockdown of Ttc21b (which we call Thm1 and which encodes THM1) in mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells expressing an IFT88-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein fusion recapitulated the aln-mutant cilial phenotype, and live imaging of these cells revealed impaired retrograde IFT. In contrast to previously described IFT mutants, Smoothened and full-length glioblastoma (GLI) proteins localize to aln-mutant cilia. We hypothesize that the aln retrograde IFT defect causes sequestration of IFT proteins in aln-mutant cilia and leads to the overactivated SHH signaling phenotype. Specifically, the aln mutation uncouples the roles of anterograde and retrograde transport in SHH signaling, suggesting that anterograde IFT is required for GLI activation and that retrograde IFT modulates this event.","dc:creator":"Tran PV","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"THM1 negatively modulates mouse sonic hedgehog signal transduction and affects retrograde intraflagellar transport in cilia."},"rdfs:label":"Immunofluorescence and whole-mount in situ hybridization"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0481f6c3-6838-4289-b3c4-f14e82c639df","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:20373395-1e21-4b89-95c7-f20915eb85d3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0208"},"dc:description":"Ttc21b encodes THM1, 'tetratricopeptide repeat-containing hedgehog modulator-1’, protein in cilia which is reminiscent of other IFT proteins, such as IFT88, IFT57 and IFT20, that are similarly localized in a punctate manner in the axoneme from the ciliary base to the tip.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18327258","rdfs:label":"Immunofluorescence analysis of THM1 (encoded by Ttc21b)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:60f93fe0-145f-47a7-9ecf-613b1b1dfa7f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7d149d0d-e548-43bc-8a31-e9be89d7f3b5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d87ceff7-4624-4dc8-b516-48c5a940af9d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"In vivo rescue assay of ttc21b MO with human mRNA.

We here performed a new high-throughput mutation analysis method to study 13 established NPHP genes (NPHP1-NPHP13) in a worldwide cohort of 1,056 patients diagnosed with NPHP-RC. We first applied multiplexed PCR-based amplification using Fluidigm Access-Array™ technology followed by barcoding and next-generation resequencing on an Illumina platform. As a result, we established the molecular diagnosis in 127/1,056 independent individuals (12.0 %) and identified a single heterozygous truncating mutation in an additional 31 individuals (2.9 %). Altogether, we detected 159 different mutations in 11 out of 13 different NPHP genes, 99 of which were novel. Phenotypically most remarkable were two patients with truncating mutations in INVS/NPHP2 who did not present as infants and did not exhibit extrarenal manifestations. In addition, we present the first case of Caroli disease due to mutations in WDR19/NPHP13 and the second case ever with a recessive mutation in GLIS2/NPHP7.

To date, pathogenic variants in at least 30 genes, coding for different structural cilia proteins, are reported to cause skeletal ciliopathies. Here, we summarize genetic and phenotypic features of 34 affected individuals from 29 families with skeletal ciliopathies. Molecular diagnostic testing was performed using massively parallel sequencing (MPS) in combination with copy number variant (CNV) analyses and in silico filtering for variants in known skeletal ciliopathy genes. We identified biallelic disease-causing variants in seven genes: DYNC2H1, KIAA0753, WDR19, C2CD3, TTC21B, EVC, and EVC2. Four variants located in non-canonical splice sites of DYNC2H1, EVC, and KIAA0753 led to aberrant splicing that was shown by sequencing of cDNA. Furthermore, CNV analyses showed an intragenic deletion of DYNC2H1 in one individual and a 6.7 Mb de novo deletion on chromosome 1q24q25 in another. In five unsolved cases, MPS was performed in family setting. In one proband we identified a de novo variant in PRKACA and in another we found a homozygous intragenic deletion of IFT74, removing the first coding exon and leading to expression of a shorter message predicted to result in loss of 40 amino acids at the N-terminus. These findings establish IFT74 as a new skeletal ciliopathy gene.

We report a 9-year-old male with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis requiring kidney transplant, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and biliary dysgenesis, found by research-based exome sequencing to have biallelic pathogenic TTC21B variants. A sibling with isolated heterotaxy was found to harbor the same variants. This case highlights the phenotypic spectrum and unpredictable manifestations of TTC21B-related disease, and also reports the first association between TTC21B and heterotaxy, nominating TTC21B as an important new heterotaxy gene.","dc:creator":"Strong A","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"A novel heterotaxy gene: Expansion of the phenotype of TTC21B-spectrum

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern. Therefore, NPHP12 and SRTD4 have been lumped into one disease entity. NPHP12 is characterized by reduced concentrating ability of the kidney, chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, cystic kidney disease, and progression to end-stage kidney disease before age 30 years. In addition to cystic kidney disease, SRTD4 is characterized by constricted thoracic cage, short ribs, shortened tubular bones, and a 'trident' appearance of the acetabular roof. In the first report, Davis et al identified a *TTC21B* variant (p.Pro209Leu) in homozygosity in affected members with NPHP12 from 2 unrelated consanguineous families of Portuguese and Egyptian descents (Davis et al 2011, PMID: 21258341). In the same report, 3 additional families with early-onset NPHP with extrarenal manifestations and another proband with SRTD were presented. Two of these NPHP12 families were found to have the p.Pro209Leu allele in compound heterozygosity with another pathogenic *TTC21B* allele: p.Cys552Ter or a splice site mutation, respectively. The proband with SRTD and the 3rd proband with NPHP were found to have compound heterozygous *TTC21B* variants p.Arg411Ter, p.Leu795Pro and p.Trp150Arg, c.3264-3>G, respectively. The variants p.Cys552Ter and p.Trp150Arg were shown to be functionally null alleles in zebrafish expression studies whereas p.Pro209Leu, p.Arg411Ter and p.Leu795Pro were shown to be functionally hypomorphic (Davis et al 2011, PMID: 21258341). In addition, heterozygous functionally pathogenic alleles were found in about 5% of the total cohort, including 3 unrelated patients with Joubert syndrome 11 (JBTS11) suggesting that *TTC21B* might be a common contributor to the total mutational load in ciliopathies. Hallbritter et al reported 6 patients in 5 families from United States (n=2), Germany (n=2) and United Kingdom (n=1). Three of these NPHP12 families with extrarenal features were found to have the p.Pro209Leu allele in compound heterozygosity with another pathogenic *TTC21B* allele: c.2868+1G>T, p.Glu414Ter or p.Asp1308Gly. One proband  from an American family was found to have a homozygous c.2264-2267dupTAGA loss of function variant and another proband was found to have compound heterozygous p.Arg411Ter and p.Thr483Aspfs*25 variants (Halbritter J et al 2013, PMID: 23559409). No functional data of these variants were provided. *TTC21B* pathogenic variants were also identified in 3 families with biopsy confirmed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and tubulointerstitial lesions in which some family members presented with hypertension and myopia. Two families carried the homozygous p.Pro209Leu variant and the third was compound heterozygous for p.Pro209Leu and a novel p.His426Asp variant (Bullich et al 2017, PMID: 26940125). Cong et al identified the homozygous p.Pro209Leu variant in seven families with FSGS by whole exome sequencing combined with homozygosity mapping (Cong et al 2014, PMID: 24876116). Their in vitro studies in mammalian cells showed that function of the TTC21B encoded tetratricopeptide repeat protein 21B (also known as the intraflagellar transport 139 homolog, IFT139B), is not restricted to the cilium but extends to the regulation of podocyte cytoskeleton architecture as reported for most proteins implicated in FSGS. However, whether these FSGS lesions are secondary to chronic tubulointerstitial lesions associated with NPHP12 needs to be clarified. Additionally, whether p.Pro209Leu is the unique *TTC21B* pathogenic variant responsible for FSGS and tubule interstitial lesions also remains to be determined.\nEvidence supporting the NPHP-*TTC21B* relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Genetic evidence on case-level data reached the maximum 12 points. Variants in *TTC21B* have been reported in at least 15 probands in 6 publications (Davis et al 2011, PMID: 21258341; Halbritter et al 2013, PMID 23559409; Abo El Fotoh WMM et al 2019, PMID: 32714622; Hibino et al 2020, PMID: 32238723; Hammarsjo et al 2021, PMID: 33875766; Strong et al 2021, PMID: 33547761). One publication described variants in this gene that segregated with disease in 3 additional family members (Davies et al 2011, PMID: 21258341). This gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence including expression data, protein interactions, rescue assays and model systems. Murine TTC21B is reminiscent of other intraflagellar transport proteins, such as IFT88, IFT57 and IFT20, that are similarly localized in a punctate manner in the axoneme from the ciliary base to the tip (Tran et al 2008, PMID: 18327258). *Ttc21b* was shown to be widely expressed, with more intense expression in the maxillary prominence, branchial arches, limb buds, somites, and spinal cord in normal embryonic mice at day 10.5, and knockout resulted in a ciliopathy phenotype of preaxial polydactyly, split and fused ribs, cortical layering abnormalities, delayed eye and forebrain development and neural tube defects (Tran et al 2008, PMID: 18327258). Murine TTC21B localizes specifically to the transition zone of the mouse photoreceptor sensory cilia, as evidenced by localization just proximal to endogenous murine retinitis pigmentosa 1 (RP1), which is located in the outer segment portion of the photoreceptor sensory cilia axoneme (Davis et al 2011, PMID: 21258341). In a zebrafish model, a single ortholog of *TTC21B* in the zebrafish genome was shown with having 68% identity and 84% similarity, with expression at the early embryonic shield stage. A translation-blocking morpholino (tb-MO) targeting *tc21b* injected into two-cell–stage embryos resulted in shortening of the embryonic axis, widening and kinking of the notochord, and broadening and thinning of the somites. These morphant phenotypes were partially rescued with co-injection of wildtype human *TTC21B* mRNA. In ciliated murine inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD3) cells, endogenous TTC21B was localized to the basal body and the ciliary axoneme, and cells stably transfected with *Ttc21b* short hairpin RNA (shRNA) displayed shortened cilia. Davis et al subsequently used these cell lines to test allele pathogenicity based on the ability of transiently transfected mutant constructs to rescue. In a mouse model, Davies et al generated a rodent-specific shRNA vector targeting the *Ttc21b* transcript. In vivo electroporation of shRNA-*Ttc21b *in neonatal rat retinas resulted in significantly shortened, abnormally shaped, photoreceptor sensory cilia. Rodent specific shRNA-resistant *Ttc21b* partially rescued cilia length and structure (Davis et al 2011, PMID: 21258341). Thus, the score for experimental evidence for this gene-disease association was 5 points. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the NPHP12-*TTC21B* relationship. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 11/10/2021 (SOP Version 8).
