Bax-mediated muscle cell death is a significant contributor to the severe neuromuscular pathology seen in the Lama2-null mouse model of MDC1A. To extend our understanding of pathogenesis due to laminin-alpha2-deficiency, we have now analyzed molecular mechanisms of Bax regulation in normal and laminin-alpha2-deficient muscles and cells, including myogenic cells obtained from patients with a clinical diagnosis of MDC1A. In mouse myogenic cells, we found that, as in non-muscle cells, Bax co-immunoprecipitated with the multifunctional protein Ku70. In addition, cell permeable pentapeptides designed from Ku70, termed Bax-inhibiting peptides (BIPs), inhibited staurosporine-induced Bax translocation and cell death in mouse myogenic cells. We also found that acetylation of Ku70, which can inhibit binding to Bax and can be an indicator of increased susceptibility to cell death, was more abundant in Lama2-null than in normal mouse muscles. Furthermore, myotubes formed in culture from human laminin-alpha2-deficient patient myoblasts produced high levels of activated caspase-3 when grown on poly-L-lysine, but not when grown on a laminin-alpha2-containing substrate or when treated with BIPs. Finally, cytoplasmic Ku70 in human laminin-alpha2-deficient myotubes was both reduced in amount and more highly acetylated than in normal myotubes.

Early muscle formation and myoblast fusion are normal, indicating that any deficiency in early Lama2 signaling does not lead to muscle pathology. In addition, innervation by the primary motor neurons is unaffected, and fiber detachment stems from muscle contraction, demonstrating that muscle atrophy through lack of motor neuron activity does not contribute to pathology in this system.

Approximately half of CMD patients present laminin alpha2-chain (merosin) deficiency in muscle biopsies, and the disease locus has been mapped to the region of the LAMA2 gene (6q22-23) in several families. Recently, two nonsense mutations in the laminin alpha2-chain gene were identified in CMD patients exhibiting complete deficiency of the laminin alpha2-chain in muscle biopsies. However, a subset of CMD patients with linkage to LAMA2 show only partial absence of the laminin alpha2-chain around muscle fibers, by immunocytochemical analysis.

Muscular dysfunction is possibly caused either by abnormal disulfide cross-links and folding of the laminin repeat, leading to the disturbance of an as yet unknown binding function of the laminin alpha2-chain and to shorter half-life of the muscle-specific laminin-2 and laminin-4 isoforms, or by increased proteolytic sensitivity, leading to truncation of the short arm.","dc:creator":"Nissinen M","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Substitution of a conserved cysteine-996 in a cysteine-rich motif of the laminin alpha2-chain in congenital muscular dystrophy with partial deficiency of the protein."}},"rdfs:label":"2666 Proband"},{"id":"cggv:61238abd-9e56-4944-990a-ddc6074b5d0e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:61238abd-9e56-4944-990a-ddc6074b5d0e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"The LAMA2 NM_000426.4:c.2986T>C variant reported in homozygosity in this proband results in a missense change (p.Cys996Arg) and is absent from gnomAD v2.1.1.

MDC1A usually presents as a severe neonatal hypotonia and failure to thrive. Muscle weakness compromises normal motor development, leading to the inability to sit unsupported or to walk independently. The phenotype associated with LAMA2 defects has been expanded to include milder and atypical cases, being now collectively known as LAMA2-related muscular dystrophies (LAMA2-MD). Through an international multicenter collaborative effort, 61 new LAMA2 disease-associated variants were identified in 86 patients, representing the largest number of patients and new disease-causing variants in a single report. The collaborative variant collection was supported by the LOVD-powered LAMA2 gene variant database (https://www.LOVD.nl/LAMA2), updated as part of this work. As of December 2017, the database contains 486 unique LAMA2 variants (309 disease-associated), obtained from direct submissions and literature reports. Database content was systematically reviewed and further insights concerning LAMA2-MD are presented. We focus on the impact of missense changes, especially the c.2461A > C (p.Thr821Pro) variant and its association with late-onset LAMA2-MD.

Later publications described additional *LAMA2* variants in relation to a less severe, adult onset form of muscular dystrophy (PMID: 21922472, PMID: 21953594). Well over 100 unique variants (including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing variants) have been reported in humans. \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found insufficient evidence of a distinct molecular mechanism and a phenotypic spectrum of disease. Both disease entities in the literature (merosin deficient or partially deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (OMIM: 607855) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy (OMIM: 618138)) are caused by loss of function variants leading to variable degrees of reduction of the alpha chain of the laminin 2 protein in a recessive fashion and, therefore, the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity (autosomal recessive *LAMA2*-related muscular dystrophy). \n\nEvidence ​supporting this gene-disease relationship includes ​case-level data from 9 probands in 7 publications (PMID: 8651294, PMID: 10852549, PMID: 18700894, PMID: 21953594, PMID: 24611677, PMID: 26104111, PMID: 30055037), extending beyond the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points). Of note, \nseveral reported individuals asserted to have a limb girdle muscular dystrophy presentation were evaluated and determined to meet the Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP-specified criteria for a limb girdle muscular dystrophy phenotype (progressive weakness in limb musculature (pelvic and shoulder girdle), independent ambulation by the age 2 years, elevated creatine kinase of >2X the upper limit of normal, muscle biopsy with dystrophic and myopathic features): PMID: 21922472; Patient 5, PMID: 21953594; Patients 6 and 8, PMID: 25663498; PMID: 27932089; Patients 1 and 2, PMID: 32904964.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence, including expression, protein interactions, functional alteration, and multiple animal models (PMID: 3278318, PMID: 8000914, PMID: 8188645, PMID: 19692349, PMID: 17438294, PMID: 9710454), also extending beyond the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points). \n\nIn summary, ​*LAMA2*​​ is definitively associated with ​autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathies Gene Curation Expert Panel on 1/25/2021 and by the ClinGen Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 2/8/2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:53f18520-6a7c-4781-ad0e-09250570f10e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
