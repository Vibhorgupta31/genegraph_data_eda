Our data suggest, however, that the clinical spectrum of pyridox(am)ine 5'-phosphate oxidase deficiency is much broader than has been reported in the literature. Sequencing of the PNPO gene was undertaken for a cohort of 82 individuals who had shown a reduction in frequency and severity of seizures in response to pyridoxine or pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Novel sequence changes were studied using a new cell-free expression system and a mass spectrometry-based assay for pyridoxamine phosphate oxidase. Three groups of patients with PNPO mutations that had reduced enzyme activity were identified: (i) patients with neonatal onset seizures responding to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (n = 6); (ii) a patient with infantile spasms (onset 5 months) responsive to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (n = 1); and (iii) patients with seizures starting under 3 months of age responding to pyridoxine (n = 8). Data suggest that certain genotypes (R225H/C and D33V) are more likely to result in seizures that to respond to treatment with pyridoxine. Other mutations seem to be associated with infertility, miscarriage and prematurity. However, the situation is clearly complex with the same combination of mutations being seen in patients who responded and did not respond to pyridoxine. It is possible that pyridoxine responsiveness in PNPO deficiency is affected by prematurity and age at the time of the therapeutic trial. Other additional factors that are likely to influence treatment response and outcome include riboflavin status and how well the foetus has been supplied with vitamin B6 by the mother. For some patients there was a worsening of symptoms on changing from pyridoxine to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Many of the mutations in PNPO affected residues involved in binding flavin mononucleotide or pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and many of them showed residual enzyme activity. One sequence change (R116Q), predicted to affect flavin mononucleotide binding and binding of the two PNPO dimers, and with high residual activity was found in Groups (ii) and (iii). This sequence change has been reported in the 1000 Genomes project suggesting it could be a polymorphism but alternatively it could be a common mutation, perhaps responsible for the susceptibility locus for genetic generalized epilepsy on 17q21.32 (close to rs72823592). We believe the reduction in PNPO activity and B6-responsive epilepsy in the patients reported here indicates that it contributes to the pathogenesis of epilepsy.

the mouse, neurotransmitter metabolism can be regulated by modulation of the synthesis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and failure to maintain pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) levels results in epilepsy. This study of five patients with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy suggests that the same is true in man. Cerebrospinal fluid and urine analyses indicated reduced activity of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase and other PLP-dependent enzymes. Seizures ceased with the administration of PLP, having been resistant to treatment with pyridoxine, suggesting a defect of pyridox(am)ine 5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO). Sequencing of the PNPO gene identified homozygous missense, splice site and stop codon mutations. Expression studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that the splice site (IVS3-1g>a) and stop codon (X262Q) mutations were null activity mutations and that the missense mutation (R229W) markedly reduced pyridox(am)ine phosphate oxidase activity. Maintenance of optimal PLP levels in the brain may be important in many neurological disorders in which neurotransmitter metabolism is disturbed (either as a primary or as a secondary phenomenon).","dc:creator":"Mills PB","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Neonatal epileptic encephalopathy caused by mutations in the PNPO gene encoding pyridox(am)ine 5'-phosphate oxidase."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient K1"},{"id":"cggv:8a5726e2-24dd-4f28-8f70-1529c1f6903c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8a5726e2-24dd-4f28-8f70-1529c1f6903c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:8a5726e2-24dd-4f28-8f70-1529c1f6903c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional data from 2 publications indicating a reduction of 100% (Mills et al, 2005) and 88% (Mills et al, 2014) in protein expression."}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Homozygous nonsense variant with functional data from 2 publications indicating a reduction of 100% (Mills et al, 2005) and 88% (Mills et al, 2014) in protein expression.

In humans, PNPO mutations have been increasingly identified in neonatal epileptic encephalopathy and more recently also in early-onset epilepsy. Till now, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying PNPO-deficiency-induced seizures due to the lack of animal models. Previously, we identified a c.95 C>A missense mutation in sugarlethal (sgll)-the Drosophila homolog of human PNPO (hPNPO)-and found mutant (sgll95) flies exhibiting a lethal phenotype on a diet devoid of VB6. Here, we report the establishment of both sgll95 and ubiquitous sgll knockdown (KD) flies as valid animal models of PNPO-deficiency-induced epilepsy. Both sgll95 and sgll KD flies exhibit spontaneous seizures before they die. Electrophysiological recordings reveal that seizures caused by PNPO deficiency have characteristics similar to that in flies treated with the GABA antagonist picrotoxin. Both seizures and lethality are associated with low PLP levels and can be rescued by ubiquitous expression of wild-type sgll or hPNPO, suggesting the functional conservation of the PNPO enzyme between humans and flies. Results from cell type-specific sgll KD further demonstrate that PNPO in the brain is necessary for seizure prevention and survival. Our establishment of the first animal model of PNPO deficiency will lead to better understanding of VB6 biology, the PNPO gene and its mutations discovered in patients, and can be a cost-effective system to test therapeutic strategies.","dc:creator":"Chi W","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Pyridox (am) ine 5'-phosphate oxidase deficiency induces seizures in Drosophila melanogaster."},"rdfs:label":"PNPO in Brain is Necessary for Seizure Prevention"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded to 1 point because it is a non-mammalian model system."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":3593,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:78de7402-400d-4c0f-96ba-6ae9c4b1bada","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0012407","gene":"hgnc:30260","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"PNPO was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive pyridoxal phosphate-responsive seizures in 2005 (Mills et al., 2005, PMID: 15772097). Pyridoxal phosphate-responsive seizures (MONDO: 0012407) is characterized by neonatal-onset severe seizures commonly observed within the first several hours to days of life, and subsequent encephalopathy. Developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, erratic eye movements, etc are also observed in patients with variants in PNPO. Fourteen variants (missense and frameshift) that have been reported in twenty-six probands in nine publications (PMIDs: 15772097, 23430561, 18485777, 24266778, 24658933, 24645144, 25296925, 28133863, 28985901) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models and a rescue (PMIDs: 15772097, 31261385, 31616300, 31759955). Chi et al., 2019 (PMID: 31261385) demonstrated cell-type specific expression in sugarlethal drosophila with the previously identified variant c.95C>A is a valid model for PNPO-deficiency induced epilepsy. Ciapaite et al., 2020 (PMID: 31759955) used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate Pnpo-deficient zebrafish in which locomotion analysis demonstrated that these zebrafish developed seizures and only 38% survived. Even though the default points for animal models is 2 points, the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP has decided to downgrade evidence in Chi et al., 2019 and Ciapaite et al., 2020 to 1 point because they are non-mammalian model systems. An additional line of experimental evidence (rescue) was published by Chen et al., 2019 (PMID: 31616300). In summary, PNPO is definitively associated with autosomal recessive pyridoxal phosphate-responsive seizures. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 12/15/2020 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f3ff7b38-dd26-458a-afbb-4870785c42ec"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
