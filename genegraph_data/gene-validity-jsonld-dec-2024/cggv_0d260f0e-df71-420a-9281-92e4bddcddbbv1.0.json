Two homologues active in branched chain amino acid metabolism have previously been identified. We have used expression in Escherichia coli to produce a previously uncharacterized ACD-like sequence (ACAD8) and define its substrate specificity. Purified recombinant enzyme had a k(cat)/K(m) of 0.8, 0.23, and 0.04 (microM(-1)s(-1)) with isobutyryl-CoA, (S) 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, and n-propionyl-CoA, respectively, as substrates. Thus, this enzyme is an isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase. A single patient has previously been described whose fibroblasts exhibit a specific deficit in the oxidation of valine. Amplified ACAD8 cDNA made from patient fibroblast mRNA was homozygous for a single nucleotide change (905G>A) in the ACAD8 coding region compared to the sequence from control cells. This encodes an Arg302Gln substitution in the full-length protein (position 280 in the mature protein), a position predicted by molecular modeling to be important in subunit interactions. The mutant enzyme was stable but inactive when expressed in E. coli. It was also stable and appropriately targeted to mitochondria, but inactive when expressed in mammalian cells. These data confirm further the presence of a separated ACD in humans specific to valine catabolism (isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, IBDH), along with the first enzymatic and molecular confirmation of a deficiency of this enzyme in a patient.","dc:creator":"Nguyen TV","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Identification of isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase and its deficiency in humans."},"rdfs:label":"ACAD8 Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0d260f0e-df71-420a-9281-92e4bddcddbb_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8cf48c4f-e4de-4157-8f29-dce300f7c024","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f55bb7db-4b13-4002-a9a2-5c12251e119e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"ENU mutagenesis screen identified a splicing mutation leading to frameshift and early termination.

Genomic DNA sequencing revealed a single-nucleotide mutation at -17 of the first intron of Acad8 in affected mice. cDNA sequencing revealed an intronic 28-bp insertion at the site of the mutation, which caused a frame shift with a premature stop codon. In vitro splicing assay confirmed that the mutation was sufficient to activate an upstream, aberrant 3' splice site. There was a reduction in the expression of Acad8 at both the mRNA and protein levels.

Only three individuals homozygous or compound heterozygous for variations in the IBD gene have been reported. We present IBD deficiency in an additional four newborns with elevated C(4)-carnitine identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) screening in Denmark and the United States. Three showed urinary excretions of isobutyryl-glycine, and in vitro probe analysis of fibroblasts from two newborns indicated enzymatic IBD defect. Molecular genetic analysis revealed seven new rare variations in the IBD gene (c.348C>A, c.400G>T, c.409G>A, c.455T>C, c.958G>A, c.1000C>T and c.1154G>A). Furthermore, sequence analysis of the short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) gene revealed heterozygosity for the prevalent c.625G>A susceptibility variation in all newborns and in the first reported IBD patient. Functional studies in isolated mitochondria demonstrated that the IBD variations present in the Danish newborn (c.409G>A and c.958G>A) together with a previously published IBD variation (c.905G>A) disturbed protein folding and reduced the levels of correctly folded IBD tetramers.

ACAD8 encodes isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBD), which catalyzes the third step of the degradation of valine. Many patients with IBD deficiency are asymptomatic and are identified through newborn screening programs with elevated C4 acylcarnitine concentrations followed by confirmation of isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. Variants in ACAD8 were first reported in humans with this deficiency in 2002 (Nguyen et al., PMID 12359132; Roe et al., 1998; PMID 9889013). At least 27 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing, deletion) have been identified in humans from at least 9 publications. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. This gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical assays and a mouse model. In summary, ACAD8 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 4/26/19 (SOP Version 5).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0d260f0e-df71-420a-9281-92e4bddcddbb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
