The last decade has witnessed huge progress in ophthalmic genetics, including the identification of three genes implicated in the pathogenicity of autosomal-recessive CSNB. However, not all patients studied could be associated with mutations in these genes and thus other genes certainly underlie this disorder. Here, we report a large multigeneration family with five affected individuals manifesting symptoms of night blindness. A genome-wide scan localized the disease interval to chromosome 15q, and recombination events in affected individuals refined the critical interval to a 10.41 cM (6.53 Mb) region that harbors SLC24A1, a member of the solute carrier protein superfamily. Sequencing of all the coding exons identified a 2 bp deletion in exon 2: c.1613_1614del, which is predicted to result in a frame shift that leads to premature termination of SLC24A1 (p.F538CfsX23) and segregates with the disorder under an autosomal-recessive model. Expression analysis using mouse ocular tissues shows that Slc24a1 is expressed in the retina around postnatal day 7. In situ and immunohistological studies localized both SLC24A1 and Slc24a1 to the inner segment, outer and inner nuclear layers, and ganglion cells of the retina, respectively. Our data expand the genetic basis of CSNB and highlight the indispensible function of SLC24A1 in retinal function and/or maintenance in humans.","dc:creator":"Riazuddin SA","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"A mutation in SLC24A1 implicated in autosomal-recessive congenital stationary night blindness."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3071ba1a-21c2-46a7-a5e9-bc53c015c7a9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:630210ca-d5d8-45d2-bd45-92e1c33eec49_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:630210ca-d5d8-45d2-bd45-92e1c33eec49","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":52,"allele":{"id":"cggv:aad2dfa0-1e01-45de-acc2-bb3d4e48823c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004727.3(SLC24A1):c.95T>A (p.Leu32Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA392912392"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Iraqi-Jewish - Nyctalopia in late teens.

Patients displaying photoreceptor dysfunction show a Riggs-electroretinogram (ERG) while patients with a signal transmission defect show a Schubert-Bornschein ERG. The latter group is subdivided into complete or incomplete (ic) CSNB. Only few CSNB cases with Riggs-ERG and only one family with a disease-causing variant in SLC24A1 have been reported. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a previously diagnosed icCSNB patient identified a homozygous nonsense variant in SLC24A1. Indeed, re-investigation of the clinical data corrected the diagnosis to Riggs-form of CSNB. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified compound heterozygous deletions and a homozygous missense variant in SLC24A1 in two other patients, respectively. ERG abnormalities varied in these three cases but all patients had normal visual acuity, no myopia or nystagmus, unlike in Schubert-Bornschein-type of CSNB. This confirms that SLC24A1 defects lead to CSNB and outlines phenotype/genotype correlations in CSNB subtypes.

It is thought that the concentration of Ca(2+) in rod outer segments is controlled by a dynamic balance between influx via cGMP-gated (CNG) channels and extrusion via Na(+)/Ca(2+), K(+) exchangers (NCKX1). The extrusion-driven lowering of rod [Ca(2+)]i following light exposure controls their light adaptation and response termination. Mutant NCKX1 has been linked to autosomal-recessive stationary night blindness. However, whether NCKX1 contributes to light adaptation has not been directly tested and the mechanisms by which human NCKX1 mutations cause night blindness are not understood. Here, we report that the deletion of NCKX1 in mice results in malformed outer segment disks, suppressed expression and function of rod CNG channels and a subsequent 100-fold reduction in rod responses, while preserving normal cone responses. The compensating loss of CNG channel function in the absence of NCKX1-mediated Ca(2+) extrusion may prevent toxic Ca(2+) buildup and provides an explanation for the stationary nature of the associated disorder in humans. Surprisingly, the lack of NCKX1 did not compromise rod background light adaptation, suggesting additional Ca(2+)-extruding mechanisms exist in these cells.","dc:creator":"Vinberg F","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"A new mouse model for stationary night blindness with mutant Slc24a1 explains the pathophysiology of the associated human disease."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model for CSNB with mutant Slc24a1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9101,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:3a957fa0-f63b-4d1a-a25b-a2b09958abae","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019118","gene":"hgnc:10975","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*SLC24A1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) in 2010 (Riazuddin et al., PMID: 20850105). Patients with CSNB mainly experience night blindness, however depending upon the clinical classification of CSNB, other ocular features including reduced visual acuity, photophobia, myopia, nystagmus, and strabismus have also been reported (PMID: 26822852). Disease-causing variants in *SLC24A1* have been implicated in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa as well (PMIDs: 27624628, 35486108, 36729443). Despite variability in phenotypic features, the cases share overlapping phenotypes consistent with a single spectrum of disease. No differences in inheritance patterns or disease mechanisms were observed. Therefore, per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, cases of congenital stationary night blindness (complete) 1D (MIM#: 613830) or retinitis pigmentosa caused by biallelic *SLC24A1* variants have been lumped together into a single disease entity referred to as SLC24A1-related retinopathy.\n\nSeven variants (including, missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, and frameshift) that have been reported in seven probands in four publications (PMIDs: 20850105, 26822852, 35486108, and 35446361) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including a mouse model (PMID: 26246500) and expression studies (PMID: 20850105). In mice, the expression of *Slc24a1* was detected in the retina around postnatal day 7. *In-situ* hybridization and immunohistological studies localized *Slc24a1* to the inner segment, outer and inner nuclear layers, and ganglion cells of the mouse retina (PMID: 20850105). A mouse model in which *Slc24a1* was deleted showed abnormally formed outer segment disks, suppressed expression, and function of rod CNG channels, which resulted in a 100-fold reduction in rod responses, whereas cone responses were normal (PMID: 26246500, 35446361).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SLC24A1* and autosomal recessive SLC24A1-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in research and clinical diagnostic settings and upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on the meeting date September 5th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3071ba1a-21c2-46a7-a5e9-bc53c015c7a9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
