Additionally, we have presented that MSH2 mutations can alter the expression profile of other BC associated biomarkers like ER, PR, CK-7, GATA-3, and E-cadherin. Subsequently, the effect of exonic deletions on secondary structure of protein has shown missing of beta and alpha helices in their protein products via in-silico analysis. However, loss of exon 3 results in the altered core protein structure leading to dysfunction protein, possible cause of BC development. No association of MSH2 exonic deletions with survival statistics was observed conceivably due to the shorter follow-up time.

Human MutS homologue 2 (hMSH2), originally identified as a human homologue of the bacterial MutS, is a tumour suppressor gene frequently mutated in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer. Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer is characterised by the early onset of colorectal cancer and the development of extracolonic cancers such as endometrial, ovarian, and urological cancers. Oestrogen receptor (ER) alpha and beta are members of a nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily. Ligand-dependent transcription of ER is regulated by the p160 steroid receptor coactivator family, the thyroid hormone receptor-associated proteins/the vitamin D receptor-interacting proteins (TRAP/DRIP) mediator complex, and the TATA box-binding protein (TBP)-free TBP associated factor complex (TFTC) type histone acetyltransferase complex. Here, we report the interaction between ER alpha/beta and hMSH2. Immunoprecipitation and glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay revealed that ER alpha and hMSH2 interacted in a ligand-dependent manner, whereas ER beta and hMSH2 interacted in a ligand-independent manner. Oestrogen receptor alpha/beta bound to hMSH2 through the hMSH3/hMSH6 interaction domain of hMSH2.

Both MutSα and MutSβ are required for the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. Defective MMR pathway is responsible for microsatellite instability, a type of genomic instability that is characteristic for tumor cells. MSH2 has been linked to Lynch Syndrome (autosomal dominant) and mismatch repair cancer syndrome (autosomal recessive), which were curated separately. This curation focuses on refuting the association with breast cancer. Evidence curated in this gene-disease relationship includes case-control data and experimental data.\n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 0 POINTS**\n\nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 5 case-control studies at the aggregate variant level. In 2021, two large case-control studies [CARRIERS (PMID: 33471974) and BCAC (PMID: 33471991); both with more than 32 thousand cases and controls] did not identify a significant association of aggregate loss of function (LOF) variants in MSH2 and breast cancer. Likewise, another two large case-control studies published in 2017 screened breast cancer cases from commercial laboratories and did not find significant association of pathogenic mutations in MSH2 with breast cancer (PMID: 28418444, 35172496). In addition, Slavin et al 2017 (PMID:28649662) showed no significant association of pathogenic MSH2 variant with breast cancer although with large confidence intervals (OR:4.72, 95% CI:0.687-22.8).\n\n**Summary of Experimental Data: 1 POINTS**\n\nWhile case control studies did not support the gene-disease association, there is experimental evidence showing that MSH2 physically interacts with estrogen receptors (0.5 point, PMID:15886699). Another study reported negative staining in breast cancer tissues, while normal MSH2 expression was observed in adjacent normal tissues (0.5 point, PMID:30149959).   \n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\nIn summary, given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between MSH2 and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as disputed by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 10/11/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 2/17/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n\nGiven the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between MSH2 and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9cb3ff3b-3e0e-42f2-85d5-3ffb1506a255"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
