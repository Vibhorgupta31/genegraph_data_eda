We report on 374 patients from 299 families with mutations in these seven genes. Most patients conformed to one of two fairly stereotyped clinical profiles; either exhibiting an in utero disease-onset (74 patients; 22.8% of all patients where data were available), or a post-natal presentation, usually within the first year of life (223 patients; 68.6%), characterized by a sub-acute encephalopathy and a loss of previously acquired skills. Other clinically distinct phenotypes were also observed; particularly, bilateral striatal necrosis (13 patients; 3.6%) and non-syndromic spastic paraparesis (12 patients; 3.4%). We recorded 69 deaths (19.3% of patients with follow-up data). Of 285 patients for whom data were available, 210 (73.7%) were profoundly disabled, with no useful motor, speech and intellectual function. Chilblains, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, cardiomyopathy, intracerebral vasculitis, peripheral neuropathy, bowel inflammation and systemic lupus erythematosus were seen frequently enough to be confirmed as real associations with the Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome phenotype. We observed a robust relationship between mutations in all seven genes with increased type I interferon activity in cerebrospinal fluid and serum, and the increased expression of interferon-stimulated gene transcripts in peripheral blood. We recorded a positive correlation between the level of cerebrospinal fluid interferon activity assayed within one year of disease presentation and the degree of subsequent disability. Interferon-stimulated gene transcripts remained high in most patients, indicating an ongoing disease process. On the basis of substantial morbidity and mortality, our data highlight the urgent need to define coherent treatment strategies for the phenotypes associated with mutations in the Aicardi-Goutières syndrome-related genes. Our findings also make it clear that a window of therapeutic opportunity exists relevant to the majority of affected patients and indicate that the assessment of type I interferon activity might serve as a useful biomarker in future clinical trials.","dc:creator":"Crow YJ","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Characterization of human disease phenotypes associated with mutations in TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR, and IFIH1."}},"rdfs:label":"Proband 12"},{"id":"cggv:3d530b86-fbc8-42d7-a98e-eed504081700","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3d530b86-fbc8-42d7-a98e-eed504081700_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:930e5706-59fd-42a3-99fd-9805aec90728_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:930e5706-59fd-42a3-99fd-9805aec90728","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:9a4aaa49-190d-4294-9c16-ac489ca71225","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_032193.4(RNASEH2C):c.428A>T (p.Lys143Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA251722"}},"detectionMethod":"Families in study underwent genome-wide homozygosity mapping together with subsequent microsatellite genotyping.

The disorder demonstrates significant genetic heterogeneity with causative mutations in five genes identified to date. Although most patients with AGS experience a severe neonatal or infantile presentation, poor neurodevelopmental outcome and reduced survival, clinical variability in the onset and severity of the condition is being increasingly recognized. A later presentation with a more variable effect on development, morbidity and mortality has been particularly observed in association with mutations in SAMHD1 and RNASEH2B. In contrast, the recurrent c.205C > T (p.R69W) RNASEH2C Asian founder mutation has previously only been identified in children with a severe AGS phenotype. Here, to our knowledge, we present the first report of marked phenotypic variability in siblings both harboring this founder mutation in the homozygous state. In this family, one female child had a severe AGS phenotype with an onset in infancy and profound developmental delay, whilst an older sister was of completely normal intellect with a normal head circumference and was only diagnosed because of the presence of chilblains and a mild hemiplegia. An appreciation of intrafamilial phenotypic expression is important in the counseling of families considering prenatal diagnosis, and may also be relevant to the assessment of efficacy in future clinical trials. In addition, marked phenotypic variation raises the possibility that more mildly affected patients are not currently identified.","dc:creator":"Vogt J","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Striking intrafamilial phenotypic variability in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome associated with the recurrent Asian founder mutation in RNASEH2C."}},"rdfs:label":"Vogt Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:2dcd036a-f674-41a1-9a40-b129c7f75182","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2dcd036a-f674-41a1-9a40-b129c7f75182_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:2dcd036a-f674-41a1-9a40-b129c7f75182_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"This variant has moderate functional evidence supporting abnormal protein function.

RNASEH2C encodes ribonuclease H2 subunit C, which comprises 164 amino acids. RNASEH enzymes endolytically cleave ribonucleotides from RNA:DNA duplexes, which occur during DNA replication, transcription and translation. RNASEH2 has been proposed to function in the removal of lagging strand Okazaki fragment RNA primers during DNA replication, as well as in the excision of single ribonucleotides from DNA:DNA duplexes (PMIDs: 21177854, 16845400).\n\nThe described autosomal recessive RNASEH2C phenotype is considered to be a form of type 1 interferonopathy, which is defined as a condition in which increased type 1 interferon signaling leads to autoimmune and neurological disorders (MONDO: 0700258). These disorders are caused by variants in genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism, sensing, and the innate immune response. Individuals with biallelic variants in RNASEH2C can present with a range of symptoms of variable severity and age of onset, within the context of an autoimmune disease.\n\nAt least 16 unique variants (missense, splicing, nonsense, indel) have been reported across 15 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 31130681, 23322642, 35551623, 16845400, 31559893, 25604658, 24183309)  are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is thought to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (model system studies, PMID: 22802351). Although the mouse phenotype was limited due to early embryonic lethality, cells obtained from knock-out mouse embryos demonstrated increased genomic ribonucleotide load consistent with the underlying disease mechanism for type 1 interferonopathy (PMID: 22802351). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between RNASEH2C and autosomal recessive RNASEH2C-related type 1 interferonopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic setting, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approached by the ClinGen Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy GCEP on the meeting date July 10, 2024 (SOP Version 10). \n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9f65b554-f11e-41ff-8a6f-dcb5d8484122"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
