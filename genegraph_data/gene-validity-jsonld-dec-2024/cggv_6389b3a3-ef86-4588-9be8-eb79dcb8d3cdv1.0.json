These case-control cohorts were evaluated separately. Previous studies on the A19911G variant have been contradictory, however.

PMID: 12139755 reports that the A19911G variant did not increase the risk of DVT independently, but modified risk (slightly increased) when present along with G20210A. The authors show that the 19911A allele was in complete linkage disequilibrium with the 20210A allele.

These blood clots can cause problems such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Most kinds of mutated coagulation factors II (F2) exhibit lower procoagulant activity, but in some cases, a higher coagulation rate has been observed. The underlying mechanism is that those variations can prevent F2s from being inhibited by antithrombin, leading to a contiguous activation of procoagulation, and causing recurrent thromboembolism. In this study, a patient was admitted to our hospital due to repeated chest pain for 2 days and aggravated for 4 h. A medical history investigation showed that he had three deep venous thromboses in the lower limbs and one portal vein thrombosis events during the past 10 years. The electrocardiogram showed Q wave elevation and slight ST segment elevation in lead V2, and coronary angiogram showed a total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. Laboratory testing found that troponin I was obviously elevated. Family history also indicated that both his father (II-3) and grandfather (I-1) died from pulmonary thromboembolism. Whole-exome sequencing was performed to detect the genetic lesion of the patient, and a novel mutation (c.1621 C>T/p.R541W) of F2 was identified in the patient. This novel mutation resulted in a substitution of arginine by tryptophan, leading to antithrombin resistance (ATR). Our study is consistent with previously published papers. In conclusion, this study not only identifies a novel mutation of F2 and will contribute to the genetic diagnosis and counseling of families with thrombosis but also suggests that the site p.R541 of F2 may play a crucial role in thrombosis.","dc:creator":"Tang Y","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"A Novel Heterozygous Variant in F2 Gene in a Chinese Patient With Coronary Thrombosis and Acute Myocardial Infarction Leads to Antithrombin Resistance."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32194638","rdfs:label":"Tang_Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Functional evidence in HEK293 cells from PMID: 28961453 suggests the variant results in mild antithrombin resistance.

(2) The sequence of the poly(A) signal and the number of 3' uridines affect the cleavage efficiency for cleavage between the poly(A) and 3' uridines by the 3' end processing machinery.

This association was made using case-level and case-control data. Prothrombin G20210A is a 3'UTR variant in the F2 gene that causes a gain of function and increased prothrombin synthesis. Individuals carrying this variant are at an increased risk of developing thrombosis and thromboembolism. Other missense/regulatory region variants with similar gain of function impact are also reported. F2 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1996 (Poort et al., PMID: 8916933). Summary of Case Level Data (5.1 points): The association is seen in at least 7 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 8916933, 16988559, 27013614, 22716977, 23265743, 32194638, 11372696). Summary of Case-Control Data (9 points): Association between the prothrombin G20210A variant and thrombotic phenotype is seen in at least 4 case-control studies (PMID: 10027711, 29051591, 9669991, 8916933) at the single variant level. More case-control evidence is available in the literature. The mechanism for disease is gain of function, with the G20210A as well as other variants observed causing resistance to inactivation by antithrombin and therefore causing an increased risk of thrombosis. (PMID:  8916933, 11443298, 15059842). Summary of Experimental Data (1 point): This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional assay that shows upregulation of mRNA 3' end processing (PMID: 11443298, 15059842). In summary, the F2- Thrombophilia due to thrombin defect gene-disease relationship is Definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
