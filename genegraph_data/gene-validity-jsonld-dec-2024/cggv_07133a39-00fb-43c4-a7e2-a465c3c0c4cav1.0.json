Germline PHOX2B alterations were also recently discovered in neuroblastoma cases with CCHS and/or Hirschsprung disease, but a comprehensive survey for mutational frequency and functional consequence has not been performed. We therefore studied a large panel of hereditary neuroblastomas to understand the frequency and functional effects of PHOX2B mutations. Three of 47 individuals with presumed genetic predisposition to neuroblastoma showed a germline PHOX2B mutation (6.4%). Mutations were also discovered in 2 of 30 human neuroblastoma-derived cell lines, but none of 86 primary tumors from patients with sporadically occurring neuroblastoma. The vast majority of primary tumors showed abundant PHOX2B mRNA expression relative to the remainder of the transcriptome. Consistent with its role as an important neurodevelopmental gene, forced overexpression of wild-type PHOX2B in neuroblastoma cell lines suppressed cell proliferation and synergized with all-trans retinoic acid to promote differentiation. Patient-derived mutant PHOX2B constructs retained the ability to suppress cellular proliferation, but were not able to promote differentiation or activate expression of a known PHOX2B target gene in vitro. These findings show that PHOX2B alterations are a rare cause of hereditary neuroblastoma, but disruption of this neurodevelopmental pathway can interfere with transcription-dependent terminal differentiation. These data also suggest that the genetics of neuroblastoma initiation are complex, and highlight genes involved in normal noradrenergic development as candidate predisposition genes.","dc:creator":"Raabe EH","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Prevalence and functional consequence of PHOX2B mutations in neuroblastoma."},"rdfs:label":"Transient cotransfection assays of PHOX2B, 1-BP DEL, 676G"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4a48a705-e78c-4f9b-911c-6381f8053b86","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:78fac410-845b-4f60-a55f-d8b761e3abd9","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Forced expression of wild-type PHOX2B enhanced DBH transactivation, but this was absent or largely attenuated in the mutant PHOX2B (PHOX2B R100L) construct cotransfections.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17637745","rdfs:label":"Transient co-transfection assay of PHOX2B R100L"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:d1dc4771-8f1c-443a-b03c-449ce0cbfc7d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8c83a7e8-cdab-49d8-897f-8a01ec153f36","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Wild-type PHOX2B complemented the effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on promoting cellular differentiation.

Phox2b-/- mice die in utero with absent autonomic nervous system circuits, since autonomic nervous system neurons either fail to form or degenerate. We first identified the Phox2b human ortholog, PHOX2B, as the gene underlying congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS, or Ondine curse), with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and de novo mutation at the first generation. We have subsequently shown that heterozygous mutations of PHOX2B may account for several combined or isolated disorders of autonomic nervous-system development--namely, tumors of the sympathetic nervous system (TSNS), such as neuroblastoma and late-onset central hypoventilation syndrome. Here, we report the clinical and molecular assessments of a cohort of 188 probands with CCHS, either isolated or associated with Hirschsprung disease and/or TSNS. The mutation-detection rate was 92.6% (174/188) in our series, and the most prevalent mutation was an in-frame duplication leading to an expansion of +5 to +13 alanines in the 20-alanine stretch at the carboxy terminal of the protein. Such findings suggest PHOX2B mutation screening as a simple and reliable tool for the diagnosis of CCHS, independent of the clinically variable phenotype. In addition, somatic mosaicism was detected in 4.5% of parents. Most interestingly, analysis of genotype-phenotype interactions strongly supports the contention that patients with CCHS who develop malignant TSNS will harbor either a missense or a frameshift heterozygous mutation of the PHOX2B gene.

This core phenotype is associated with lower-penetrance anomalies of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) including Hirschsprung disease and tumors of neural-crest derivatives such as ganglioneuromas and neuroblastomas. In mice, the development of ANS reflex circuits is dependent on the paired-like homeobox gene Phox2b. Thus, we regarded its human ortholog, PHOX2B, as a candidate gene in CCHS. We found heterozygous de novo mutations in PHOX2B in 18 of 29 individuals with CCHS. Most mutations consisted of 5-9 alanine expansions within a 20-residue polyalanine tract probably resulting from non-homologous recombination. We show that PHOX2B is expressed in both the central and the peripheral ANS during human embryonic development. Our data support an essential role of PHOX2B in the normal patterning of the autonomous ventilation system and, more generally, of the ANS in humans.","dc:creator":"Amiel J","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Polyalanine expansion and frameshift mutations of the paired-like homeobox gene PHOX2B in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12640453","rdfs:label":"OH253"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The proband carries a de novo cytosine insertion in a stretch of 4 cytosines, 618_619insC, in the PHOX2B gene, resulting in a frameshift downstream of the homeobox, predicting a mutant protein with no known function."},{"id":"cggv:eb6ce4e7-7c0c-4d71-a5f4-bee3680f6d15_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:693141ab-ed23-41b9-bdc1-3d7031ce1939","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002791","obo:HP_0002251","obo:HP_0003006"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:eb6ce4e7-7c0c-4d71-a5f4-bee3680f6d15_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:af9f4b0d-dff0-42cb-be09-607a0fb7f7dc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003924.3(PHOX2B):c.299G>T (p.Arg100Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA117902"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17637745"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17637745","rdfs:label":"ANB6-001"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2.5,"dc:description":"This variant was proven to have a functional consequence in this paper."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":11}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":2943,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:9eac6c77-e3e2-4069-8c17-7d1e47d5208a","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0020493","gene":"hgnc:9143","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":" Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare genetic disorder of the autonomic nervous system characterized by an altered chemosensory response to hypercapnia and hypoxia, typically most pronounced during sleep. PHOX2B was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) in 2003 (Amiel et al., PMID: 12640453). PHOX2B encodes a highly conserved paired box homeodomain transcription factor, characterized by two polyalanine repeats of 9 and 20 residues in the C-terminal region. There are two types of PHOX2B mutations associated with CCHS: Polyalanine repeat mutations (PARMs) and nonpolyalanine repeat mutations (NPARMs). PARMs are in-frame nucleotide duplications inside the 20 alanine stretch, leading to expansions from +5 to +13 alanine residues, and are detected in about 90% CCHS patients. NPARMs include missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations, leading to different aberrant C-terminal of the protein, and are detected in about 8% CCHS patients. In MONDO, an assertion has been made for two disease entities: congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) associated with PARMs and Haddad syndrome (CCHS occurs concurrently with Hirschsprung disease) associated with NPARMs demonstrating different molecular mechanisms. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism(s) AND phenotypic variability underlying the two disease entities. For phenotypic variability, PHOX2B PARMs are mainly associated with isolated CCHS; whereas PHOX2B NPARMs are associated with Haddad syndrome including a much higher rate of Hirschsprung disease and more frequent neuroblastoma. The estimated incidence of neuroblastoma in patients with NPARMs is 50% compared to 1% among patients with PARMs (Berry-Kravis et al., 2006 PMID: 16888290). Therefore, we have split curations for the disease entities, PHOX2B PARMs-CCHS; PHOX2B NPARMs-Haddad syndrome (neuroblastoma, Hirschsprung disease in CCHS syndrome, susceptibility to) being curated here. Six variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, deletion) that have been reported in 9 probands in five publications (PMIDs:12640453, 15657873, 29543228, 29696799, 17637745) are included in this curation. This gene-disease association is also supported by function studies (PMIDs: 17637745, 15888479). In summary, PHOX2B-NPARM is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Haddad syndrome (neuroblastoma, Hirschsprung disease in CCHS syndrome, susceptibility to). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:07133a39-00fb-43c4-a7e2-a465c3c0c4ca"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
