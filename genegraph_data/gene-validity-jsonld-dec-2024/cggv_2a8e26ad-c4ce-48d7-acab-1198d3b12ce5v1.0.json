A not precisely known proportion of these diseases are genetically determined. We genotyped 43 index-patients (30 DCM, 10 ARVC, 3 RCM) with advanced or end stage cardiomyopathy using a gene panel which covered 46 known cardiomyopathy disease genes. Fifty-three variants with possible impact on disease in 33 patients were identified. Of these 27 (51%) were classified as likely pathogenic or pathogenic in the MYH7, MYL2, MYL3, NEXN, TNNC1, TNNI3, DES, LMNA, PKP2, PLN, RBM20, TTN, and CRYAB genes. Fifty-six percent (n = 24) of index-patients carried a likely pathogenic or pathogenic mutation. Of these 75% (n = 18) were familial and 25% (n = 6) sporadic cases. However, severe cardiomyopathy seemed to be not characterized by a specific mutation profile. Remarkably, we identified a novel homozygous PKP2-missense variant in a large consanguineous family with sudden death in early childhood and several members with heart transplantation in adolescent age.","dc:creator":"Klauke B","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"High proportion of genetic cases in patients with advanced cardiomyopathy including a novel homozygous Plakophilin 2-gene mutation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29253866","rdfs:label":"III-4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Occurence in DCM individual"},{"id":"cggv:b05d2500-4c32-4186-9c4a-fed706e00795_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fe745f3d-f55c-4123-ba51-f5c4021fe7b7","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"5 desmosomal genes sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:b05d2500-4c32-4186-9c4a-fed706e00795_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:76542986-244f-495d-9fa6-adae888de33d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001005242.3(PKP2):c.791C>T (p.Ala264Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA012499"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20716751","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is a familial disorder in 25% to 50% of patients, but the genetic basis in the majority of cases remains unknown.

We have ablated the plakophilin 2 gene in mice. The resulting mutant mice exhibit lethal alterations in heart morphogenesis and stability at mid-gestation (E10.5-E11), characterized by reduced trabeculation, disarrayed cytoskeleton, ruptures of cardiac walls, and blood leakage into the pericardiac cavity. In the absence of plakophilin 2, the cytoskeletal linker protein desmoplakin dissociates from the plaques of the adhering junctions that connect the cardiomyocytes and forms granular aggregates in the cytoplasm. By contrast, embryonic epithelia show normal junctions. Thus, we conclude that plakophilin 2 is important for the assembly of junctional proteins and represents an essential morphogenic factor and architectural component of the heart.","dc:creator":"Grossmann KS","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Requirement of plakophilin 2 for heart morphogenesis and cardiac junction formation."},"rdfs:label":"human gene rescue of PKP2 deficient transgenic mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":1329,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":0.8,"subject":{"id":"cggv:11f67328-d9f8-46aa-8b36-96e952525bf5","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005021","gene":"hgnc:9024","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"PKP2 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 2010 (Elliot et al., 2010, PMID 20716751) and 2011 (Garcia-Pavia et al., 2011, PMID 21859740). PKP2 has also been curated by the Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) Gene Curation Expert Panel for ARVC (Definitive, March 8, 2018). Human genetic evidence supporting the relationship of PKP2 with DCM includes case-level data; however, the majority of variants reported are present in control populations (gnomAD) at frequencies incompatible with the prevalence of DCM. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least one case-control study at the aggregate variant level (Mazzarrotto et al., 2020, PMID 31983221); however, no significant enrichment of PKP2 variants in DCM was shown. In addition, this gene-disease assertion is supported by expression studies as PKP2 has been shown to be expressed in the cardiac desmosome and is critical for cardiac junction formation and heart morphogenesis (Grossman et al., 2004, PMID 15479741). In summary, the evidence presented for this gene-disease relationship does not provide convincing human genetic evidence in support of or refuting the role of PKP2 and autosomal dominant DCM. The relationship of PKP2 with DCM is unclear and therefore classified as disputed. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on June, 26, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\nExperts in the DCM GCEP feel that the role of missense variants in DCM in an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is subject to skepticism at this time and therefore published missense variation did not contribute to the genetic evidence score. In addition, it was decided by the GCEP to modify the calculated classification to disputed given this concern.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2a8e26ad-c4ce-48d7-acab-1198d3b12ce5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
