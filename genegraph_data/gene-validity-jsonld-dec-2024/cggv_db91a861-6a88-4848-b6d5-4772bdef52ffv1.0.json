Today, only for at most half of patients a diagnosis is made. Knowing the cause of the ID is important for patients and their relatives, as it allows for appropriate medical care, prognosis on further development of the disorder, familial counselling or access to support groups. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) now offers the possibility to identify the genetic cause for patients for which all previously available genetic tests, including karyotyping, specific gene analysis, or microarray analysis did not reveal causative abnormalities. However, data analysis of WES experiments is challenging. Here we present an analysis workflow implementable in any laboratory, requiring no bioinformatics knowledge. We demonstrated its feasibility on a cohort of 10 patients, in which we found a conclusive diagnosis in 3 and a likely diagnosis in 2 more patients. Of the three conclusive diagnoses, one was a clinically suspected mutation missed by Sanger sequencing, and one was an atypical presentation of a known monogenic disorder, highlighting two essential strengths of WES-based diagnostics.

The syndrome can be either caused by a microdeletion in chromosomal region 9q34.3 or by a mutation in the euchromatin histone methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1) gene. Since the early 1990s, 85 patients have been described, of which the majority had a 9q34.3 microdeletion (>85%). So far, no clear genotype-phenotype correlation could be observed by studying the clinical and molecular features of both 9q34.3 microdeletion patients and patients with an intragenic EHMT1 mutation. Thus, to further expand the genotypic and phenotypic knowledge about the syndrome, we here report 29 newly diagnosed patients, including 16 patients with a 9q34.3 microdeletion and 13 patients with an EHMT1 mutation, and review previous literature. The present findings are comparable to previous reports. In addition to our former findings and recommendations, we suggest cardiac screening during follow-up, because of the possible occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, clinicians and caretakers should be aware of the regressive behavioral phenotype that might develop at adolescent/adult age and seems to have no clear neurological substrate, but is rather a so far unexplained neuropsychiatric feature.","dc:creator":"Willemsen MH","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Update on Kleefstra Syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22670141","rdfs:label":"Patient 26"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"This variant has no further evidence of variant pathogenicity so it was downgraded to 0.1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:db91a861-6a88-4848-b6d5-4772bdef52ff_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:67059ff8-6134-420b-a35b-edb3b8cf194f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:91779648-4847-4a64-8d26-5a441bf80aa3","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"detectionMethod":"Deletions were detected by\nroutine subtelomeric multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification\n(MLPA) (P070; MRC Holland)/FISH (probes from Vysis)\nor whole genome array analysis with different platforms (Agilent\nTechnologies and Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., USA).

Next, RNA sequencing was used to study the region of interest at the transcriptional level. Using this workflow, we identified a de novo mutation in the euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 1 gene (EHMT1) of an autistic patient with dysmorphisms. Sequencing of EHMT1 transcripts showed that the premature termination codon (Trp1138Ter) created by a single nucleotide change elicited nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, which led to haploinsufficiency already at the transcriptional level. Database and literature search provided evidence that this mutation caused Kleefstra syndrome (KS), which was confirmed by the presence of the disorder-specific phenotype in the patient. We provide a proof of principle that the implemented method is capable to elucidate the genetic etiology of individuals with syndromic autism. The novel mutation detected in the EHMT1 gene is responsible for KS's symptoms. In addition, further genetic factors might be involved in the ASD pathogenesis of the patient including a missense DPP6 mutation (Arg322Cys), which segregated with the autistic phenotype within the family.","dc:creator":"Bock I","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Targeted next generation sequencing of a panel of autism-related genes identifies an EHMT1 mutation in a Kleefstra syndrome patient with autism and normal intellectual performance."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27651234","rdfs:label":"Boch KS/ASD patient"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This null variant was de novo, but it also was found in a patient with ASD and features consistent with KS.

In agreement with the cognitive disturbances observed in patients with KS, we detected deficits in fear extinction learning and both novel and spatial object recognition in Ehmt1(+/-) mice. These learning and memory deficits were associated with a significant reduction in dendritic arborization and the number of mature spines in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of Ehmt1(+/-) mice. In-depth analysis of the electrophysiological properties of CA3-CA1 synapses revealed no differences in basal synaptic transmission or theta-burst induced long-term potentiation (LTP). However, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) was significantly increased in Ehmt1(+/-) neurons, pointing to a potential deficiency in presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Accordingly, a reduction in the frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) was observed in Ehmt1(+/-) neurons.

Moreover, density of dendritic protrusions of neuronal cells derived from KS-ASD hiPSCs was lower than that of control cells. Synaptic connections and spontaneous neuronal activity measured by live cell calcium imaging could be detected after 5 weeks of differentiation, when KS-ASD cells exhibited higher sensitivity of calcium responses to acetylcholine stimulation indicating a lower nicotinic cholinergic tone at baseline condition in KS-ASD cells.

Finally, we show that loss of function of EHMT1 ultimately resulted in less regular network bursting patterns later in development.

KS is an intellectual disability (ID) syndrome, with general developmental delay, hypotonia, and craniofacial dysmorphisms as additional core features. Recent studies have been focused on the role of EHMT1 in learning and memory, linked to the ID phenotype of KS patients. In this study we used the Ehmt1(+/-) mouse model, and investigated whether the core features of KS were mimicked in these mice. When comparing Ehmt1(+/-) mice to wildtype littermates we observed delayed postnatal growth, eye opening, ear opening, and upper incisor eruption, indicating a delayed postnatal development. Furthermore, tests for muscular strength and motor coordination showed features of hypotonia in young Ehmt1(+/-) mice. Lastly, we found that Ehmt1(+/-) mice showed brachycephalic crania, a shorter or bent nose, and hypertelorism, reminiscent of the craniofacial dysmorphisms seen in KS. In addition, gene expression analysis revealed a significant upregulation of the mRNA levels of Runx2 and several other bone tissue related genes in P28 Ehmt1(+/-) mice. Runx2 immunostaining also appeared to be increased. The mRNA upregulation was associated with decreased histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) levels, the epigenetic mark deposited by Ehmt1, in the promoter region of these genes. Together, Ehmt1(+/-) mice indeed recapitulate KS core features and can be used as an animal model for Kleefstra syndrome.

This association was made using case-level data, and experimental data. At least 14 unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion) have been reported in humans  (Williemsen 2012). Though this evaluation focuses on sequence-level variation in the EHMT1 gene, Kleefstra syndrome is also caused by larger deletions of the 9q34 region; these deletions range in size and have variable breakpoints, but all include at least part of the EHMT1 gene.  Please see GeneReviews for further discussion of the molecular mechanism of this disorder. EHMT1 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2005 (Kleefstra et al.). Association is seen in at least 14 probands in more than 2 publications (22670141, 27651234). Variants in this gene were found to be de novo in at least 6 cases. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by mice models, drosophila models, cell culture models, expression studies, and functional alteration studies implicating variants in this gene with neuronal dysfunction. In summary, EHMT1 is definitively associated with AD KS. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
