Cells lacking either protein have a strong mutator phenotype and display microsatellite instability, yet mutations in the hMLH1 gene account for approximately 50% of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer families, whereas hPMS2 mutations are substantially less frequent and less penetrant. Similarly, in the mouse model, Mlh1-/- animals are highly cancer prone and present with gastrointestinal tumors at an early age, whereas Pms2-/- mice succumb to cancer much later in life and do not present with gastrointestinal tumors. This evidence suggested that MLH1 might functionally interact with another MutL homologue, which compensates, at least in part, for a deficiency in PMS2. Sterility of Mlh1-/-, Pms2-/-, and Mlh3-/- mice implicated the Mlh1/Pms2 and Mlh1/Mlh3 heterodimers in meiotic recombination. We now show that the hMLH1/hMLH3 heterodimer, hMutLgamma, can also assist in the repair of base-base mismatches and single extrahelical nucleotides in vitro. Analysis of hMLH3 expression in colon cancer cell lines indicated that the protein levels vary substantially and independently of hMLH1. If hMLH3 participates in MMR in vivo, its partial redundancy with hPMS2, coupled with the fluctuating expression levels of hMLH3, may help explain the low penetrance of hPMS2 mutations in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer families.","dc:creator":"Cannavo E","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Expression of the MutL homologue hMLH3 in human cells and its role in DNA mismatch repair."},"rdfs:label":"in vitro MMR assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:cd535817-7bc0-4cb4-a11d-f837cd5c58cf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:02f0f4ef-76c5-4344-b82b-a650b37aa531","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Yeast two-hybrid assay showing that hMLH3 forms heterodimers by interacting with hMLH1 (residues 492â€“742).","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11292842","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"In human cells, hMLH1, hMLH3, hPMS1 and hPMS2 are four recognised and distinctive homologues of MutL, an essential component of the bacterial DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. The hMLH1 protein forms three different heterodimers with one of the other MutL homologues. As a first step towards functional analysis of these molecules, we determined the interacting domains of each heterodimer and tried to understand their common features. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we show that these MutL homologues can form heterodimers by interacting with the same amino acid residues of hMLH1, residues 492-742. In contrast, three hMLH1 partners, hMLH3, hPMS1 and hPMS2 contain the 36 homologous amino acid residues that interact strongly with hMLH1. Contrary to the previous studies, these homologous residues reside at the N-terminal regions of three subdomains conserved in MutL homologues in many species. Interestingly, these residues in hPMS2 and hMLH3 may form coiled-coil structures as predicted by the MULTICOIL program. Furthermore, we show that there is competition for the interacting domain in hMLH1 among the three other MutL homologues. Therefore, the quantitative balance of these three MutL heterodimers may be important in their functions.","dc:creator":"Kondo E","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"The interacting domains of three MutL heterodimers in man: hMLH1 interacts with 36 homologous amino acid residues within hMLH3, hPMS1 and hPMS2."},"rdfs:label":"Yeast 2 hybrid assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Redundant information with Cannavo also scored"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.6},{"id":"cggv:5d54ad37-37e4-4321-a4b7-df423bde0943_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9b0ac600-6dc5-43d9-8cd2-a7cb36d6ff02","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:06f7afc4-93da-4f9f-8b92-b74530226d29","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"both phenotypes involved GI adenomas and carcinoma","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18551179","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"DNA mismatch repair suppresses gastrointestinal tumorgenesis. Four mammalian E. coli MutL homologues heterodimerize to form three distinct complexes: MLH1/PMS2, MLH1/MLH3, and MLH1/PMS1. To understand the mechanistic contributions of MLH3 and PMS2 in gastrointestinal tumor suppression, we generated Mlh3(-/-);Apc(1638N) and Mlh3(-/-);Pms2(-/-);Apc(1638N) (MPA) mice. Mlh3 nullizygosity significantly increased Apc frameshift mutations and tumor multiplicity. Combined Mlh3;Pms2 nullizygosity further increased Apc base-substitution mutations. The spectrum of MPA tumor mutations was distinct from that observed in Mlh1(-/-);Apc(1638N) mice, implicating the first potential role for MLH1/PMS1 in tumor suppression. Because Mlh3;Pms2 deficiency also increased gastrointestinal tumor progression, we used array-CGH to identify a recurrent tumor amplicon. This amplicon contained a previously uncharacterized Transducin enhancer of Split (Tle) family gene, Tle6-like. Expression of Tle6-like, or the similar human TLE6D splice isoform in colon cancer cells increased cell proliferation, colony-formation, cell migration, and xenograft tumorgenicity. Tle6-like;TLE6D directly interact with the gastrointestinal tumor suppressor RUNX3 and antagonize RUNX3 target transactivation. TLE6D is recurrently overexpressed in human colorectal cancers and TLE6D expression correlates with RUNX3 expression. Collectively, these findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of individual MutL homologue tumor suppression and demonstrate an association between TLE mediated antagonism of RUNX3 and accelerated human colorectal cancer progression.","dc:creator":"Chen PC","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Novel roles for MLH3 deficiency and TLE6-like amplification in DNA mismatch repair-deficient gastrointestinal tumorigenesis and progression."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.6},{"id":"cggv:5d54ad37-37e4-4321-a4b7-df423bde0943_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0cc1082a-03a5-4c8c-b40c-f02e129b1fad_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0cc1082a-03a5-4c8c-b40c-f02e129b1fad","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":48,"allele":{"id":"cggv:4cc4dcfb-6deb-4e6d-afd3-321a6cabd0f0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001040108.2(MLH3):c.3563C>G (p.Ser1188Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7275454"}},"detectionMethod":"Tested MLH3 p.Ser1188Ter ONLY","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0200063","obo:HP_0003003"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"\"APC, LS genes negative'","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:bb0f365d-cb42-435f-aeef-bfea3c32a686_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4cc4dcfb-6deb-4e6d-afd3-321a6cabd0f0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30573798","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Some 10% of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and 80% of attenuated polyposis (AFAP) cases remain molecularly unexplained.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability with MLH3 -associated phenotypes. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split and curated separate disease entities: autosomal dominant Colorectal cancer, hereditary nonpolyposis, type 7 (MONDO:0013725, OMIM:614385), and autosomal recessive intestinal polyposis syndrome (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0015185). Two variants (nonsense and frameshift) that have been reported in five probands in two publications (PMIDs: 30573798, 31043711) are included in this curation of the recessive entity. Four probands from Finland reported in Olkinuora et al. all carry the same nonsense variant in a homozygous state, p.Ser1188Ter. At least one individual homozygous for the p.Ser1188Ter did not have any polyposis of gastrointestinal cancer described. One Swedish proband with polyps with the p.Ser1188Ter variant was also described in Olkinuora et al. Yang, et al. describes a proband homozygous for a different frameshift variant (p.Asp206ThrfsTer18) and no polyposis, but a diagnosis of rectal cancer at 44 years. The proposed mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function; however, no probands described in the literature display microsatellite instability or other evidence explaining the mechanism of tumorigenesis, again suggesting that MLH3 plays a minor role in mismatch repair. This gene-disease relationship is supported by one mouse model showing an accumulation of gastrointestinal tumors in homozygous MLH3 knockout mice (PMIDs: 18551179). Due to the frequency of the p.Ser1188Ter variant in the population studied (and presence of at least one homozygote in the gnomAD database), and the lack of replication of the initially-published data, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between MLH3 and autosomal recessive intestinal polyposis syndrome. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 09/27/2024 (SOP Version 10).\n\nThere is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.
