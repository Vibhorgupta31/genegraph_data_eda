We also show that the microtubule-binding activity of Cep57 is involved in the timely removal of Mad1 from kinetochores. Thus, these findings reveal that the KMN network-binding protein Cep57 is a mitotic kinetochore component, and demonstrate the functional connection between the KMN network and the SAC.

To investigate these, we have generated a mouse model mimicking this disease mutation. Cep57T/T mice died within 24 hours after birth with short, curly tails and severely impaired vertebral ossification. Osteoblasts in lumbosacral vertebrae of Cep57T/T mice were deficient for Fgf2, a Cep57 binding partner implicated in diverse biological processes, including bone formation. Furthermore, a broad spectrum of tissues of Cep57T/T mice had severe aneuploidy at birth, consistent with the MVA patient phenotype. Cep57T/T mouse embryonic fibroblasts and patient-derived skin fibroblasts failed to undergo centrosome maturation in G2 phase, causing premature centriole disjunction, centrosome amplification, aberrant spindle formation, and high rates of chromosome missegregation. Mice heterozygous for the truncating frameshift mutation or a Cep57-null allele were overtly indistinguishable from WT mice despite reduced Cep57 protein levels, yet prone to aneuploidization and cancer, with tumors lacking evidence for loss of heterozygosity. This study identifies Cep57 as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor with biologically diverse roles in centrosome maturation and Fgf2-mediated bone formation.","dc:creator":"Aziz K","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mosaic-variegated aneuploidy syndrome mutation or haploinsufficiency in Cep57 impairs tumor suppression."},"rdfs:label":"TALEN-mediated knock-in strategy"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":564,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:c2455696-3601-4c86-93fb-6da22466f98d","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013582","gene":"hgnc:30794","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Centrosomal protein 57kDa, also known as Translokin or TLk, encoded by CEP57 gene functions in microtubular stabilization and mediates its nuclear translocation and mitogenic activity. Mutations in this gene have been found to cause mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome type 2. Snape K et al., (2011) using exome sequencing identified biallelic LoF CEP57 mutation as a cause of constitutional mosaic aneuploidies. In this article, two Mexican siblings with MVA carry the same compound heterozygous CEP57 mutations, a 2-bp deletion (520delGA) in exon 5, and an 11-bp duplication in exon 9 (915_925dup11); Another 2 individuals with biallelic CEP57 mutations, homozygous for c.341C>T;p.R81X, and c.915_925dup11, from a cohort of 13 BUB1B negative families with MVA were also identified. De La Torre-Garcia et al., (2018) identified a Mexico boy with MVA homozygous for CEP57 c.915_925dup11. Pinson L et al., (2014) found a Morocan girl from a consanguineous family homozygous for CEP57 c.915_925dup11. Brightman DS et al.(2018) found a Pakistani girl with MVA of a consanguineous family homozygous for CEP57 c.697delA, p.Lys235Argfs*31). Experimental evidences showed CEP57 protein is localized to kinetochore contributing spindle microtubule organization, CEP57 depletion leads to missegregation of chromosome. siRNA resistant Cep57 wt with mutated siRNA targeted region in HeLa cells rescued the phenotypes.  Research on CEP57 gene function in microtubule stability has been upheld over time. In summary, there have been sufficient evidences supporting the association of CEP57 with autosomal recessive inherited Mosaic Variegated Aneuploidy (MVA) type 2.\ngenetic data and experimental data are replicate to confirm the association of the this gene with MVA.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c44921de-14cf-4907-8bef-1525329ee89c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
