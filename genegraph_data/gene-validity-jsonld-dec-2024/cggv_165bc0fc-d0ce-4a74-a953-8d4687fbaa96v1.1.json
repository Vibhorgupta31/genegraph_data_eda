Over 20 different RP loci have been mapped, of which six have been identified. Three of these encode members of the rod photoreceptor visual transduction cascade: rhodopsin, the rod cGMP-gated cation channel alpha subunit, and the beta subunit of cGMP-phosphodiesterase (PDEB). As null mutations in PDEB cause some cases of RP and since both alpha and beta subunits are required for full phosphodiesterase activity, we examined the gene encoding the alpha subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDEA) in 340 unrelated patients with RP. We found three point mutations in PDEA in affected members of two pedigrees with recessive RP. Each mutation alters an essential functional domain of the encoded protein and likely disrupts its catalytic function. PDEA is the seventh RP gene identified, highlighting the extensive genetic heterogeneity of the disorder and encouraging further investigation into the role of other members of the phototransduction cascade in RP.","dc:creator":"Huang SH","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa caused by mutations in the alpha subunit of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:165bc0fc-d0ce-4a74-a953-8d4687fbaa96_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:165bc0fc-d0ce-4a74-a953-8d4687fbaa96_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4c8d6c12-8f34-46b7-8438-def31576dfea","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ce1820d3-ad3c-4b26-b29e-aa7765ab9262","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"PDE6A appears to have baseline expression in many tissues, but has a much higher level of expression in adult retina tissues.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30239781","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The human eye is built from several specialized tissues which direct, capture and pre-process information to provide vision.

The catalytic core of rod PDE6 is a unique heterodimer of PDE6A and PDE6B catalytic subunits. The functional significance of rod PDE6 heterodimerization and conserved differences between PDE6AB and cone PDE6C and the individual properties of PDE6A and PDE6B are unknown. To address these outstanding questions, we expressed chimeric homodimeric enzymes, enhanced GFP (EGFP)-PDE6C-A and EGFP-PDE6C-B, containing the PDE6A and PDE6B catalytic domains, respectively, in transgenic Xenopus laevis. Similar to EGFP-PDE6C, EGFP-PDE6C-A and EGFP-PDE6C-B were targeted to the rod outer segments and concentrated at the disc rims. PDE6C, PDE6C-A, and PDE6C-B were isolated following selective immunoprecipitation of the EGFP fusion proteins. All three enzymes, PDE6C, PDE6C-A, and PDE6C-B, hydrolyzed cGMP with similar K(m) (20-23 μM) and k(cat) (4200-5100 s(-1)) values. Likewise, the K(i) values for PDE6C, PDE6C-A, and PDE6C-B inhibition by the cone- and rod-specific PDE6 γ-subunits (Pγ) were comparable. Recombinant cone transducin-α (Gα(t2)) and native rod Gα(t1) fully and potently activated PDE6C, PDE6C-A, and PDE6C-B. In contrast, the half-maximal activation of bovine rod PDE6 required markedly higher concentrations of Gα(t2) or Gα(t1). Our results suggest that PDE6A and PDE6B are enzymatically equivalent. Furthermore, PDE6A and PDE6B are similar to PDE6C with respect to catalytic properties and the interaction with Pγ but differ in the interaction with transducin. This study significantly limits the range of mechanisms by which conserved differences between PDE6A, PDE6B, and PDE6C may contribute to remarkable differences in rod and cone physiology.","dc:creator":"Muradov H","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Rod phosphodiesterase-6 PDE6A and PDE6B subunits are enzymatically equivalent."},"rdfs:label":"PDE6A encodes a rod-associated cGMP phosphodiesterase."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Default scoring is considered appropriate given the link between the enzymatic activity of the gene product and the regulation of visual excitation through cGMP."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:165bc0fc-d0ce-4a74-a953-8d4687fbaa96_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:85d30170-4d45-4440-a77e-7ec444493a74","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cf0aa13a-258e-4b81-98a8-352ddbb627b3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Rod ERG response shows improvement from undetectable to detectable following AAV-Pde6a injection (Fig. 1).

IRD covers a set of genetically highly heterogeneous disorders with more than 150 genes associated with one or more clinical forms of IRD. Molecular genetic diagnosis has become increasingly important especially due to expanding number of gene therapy strategies under development. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of gene panels has proven a valuable diagnostic tool in IRD. We present the molecular findings of 677 individuals, residing in Denmark, with IRD and report 806 variants of which 187 are novel. We found that deletions and duplications spanning one or more exons can explain 3% of the cases, and thus copy number variation (CNV) analysis is important in molecular genetic diagnostics of IRD. Seven percent of the individuals have variants classified as pathogenic or likely-pathogenic in more than one gene. Possible Danish founder variants in EYS and RP1 are reported. A significant number of variants were classified as variants with unknown significance; reporting of these will hopefully contribute to the elucidation of the actual clinical consequence making the classification less troublesome in the future.

Affected individuals with biallelic causal variants in *PDE6A* have since been identified in a number of subsequent publications. Phenotypes generally include a combination of early onset night blindness, reduced visual acuity, optic disc pallor, retinal blood vessel attenuation, and decreased amplitude of light-adapted and especially dark-adapted electroretinogram responses. Additional features can include bone spicule pigmentation of the retina, peripheral visual field loss, hypermetropia, and/or macular degeneration. Because of the broad spectrum of potential phenotypes, these cases with causal variants in *PDE6A* have been curated under the inclusive disease name *PDE6A*-related retinopathy.\n\nTwelve suspected deleterious variants in *PDE6A* were scored as part of this curation (two nonsense and three affecting splicing), which have been collectively reported in eleven probands in five publications (PMID: 7493036, PMID: 21039428, PMID: 17110911, PMID: 30718709, PMID: 26321862). Ten probands were homozygous for the variant of interest, and six were known to be members of consanguineous families. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function in *PDE6A*, characterized in at least some cases by variants predicted to trigger the absence of the gene product. Two large families with co-segregation of the genotype and phenotype among affected members were scored as part of this curation (PMID: 21039428, PMID: 17110911), while other segregation evidence was available (PMID: 20940301) but not included in this curation as the maximum scoring for this evidence type had already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by expression evidence that adult retina is the human tissue type with highest levels of *PDE6A* mRNA (PMID: 30239781). Biochemical data similarly support a structural function in the retina by showing that *PDE6A* encodes a cGMP phosphodiesterase associated specifically with rod photoreceptor cells (PMID: 20940301). The PDE6A protein physically forms a complex with PDE6B and PDE6G (PMID: 227876), which are encoded by genes that harbor variants associated with retinitis pigmentosa 40 and retinitis pigmentosa 57, respectively. A canine model of biallelic *Pde6a* loss-of-function recapitulates features of the human patients such as visual defects, retinal blood vessel attenuation, and rod photoreceptor cell loss from the outer segment (PMID: 18775863). The development of these phenotypes can be prevented by gene therapy in the form of adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery of wild-type canine *Pde6a* (PMID: 28676737). Murine models of biallelic *Pde6a* loss-of-function similarly recapitulate human patient features and confirm the molecular defect of decreased cGMP phosphodiesterase activity in retinal tissues (PMID: 18849587). Additional experimental evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 34095146, PMID: 29212391) but has not included in this curation since the maximum scoring for this category has already been reached.\n\nIn summary, *PDE6A* is definitively associated with *PDE6A*-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a definitive classification. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on December 1st, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:165bc0fc-d0ce-4a74-a953-8d4687fbaa96"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
