Candidates were selected via bioinformatics and data mining on the basis of their resemblance to other FA genes/proteins acting in the FA pathway, such as: degree of evolutionary conservation, presence of nuclear localization signals and pattern of tissue-dependent expression. We found a candidate, KIAA1794 on chromosome 15q25-26, to be mutated in 8 affected individuals previously assigned to complementation group I. Western blots of endogenous FANCI indicated that functionally active KIAA1794 protein is lacking in FA-I individuals. Knock-down of KIAA1794 expression by siRNA in HeLa cells caused excessive chromosomal breakage induced by mitomycin C, a hallmark of FA cells. Furthermore, phenotypic reversion of a patient-derived cell line was associated with a secondary genetic alteration at the KIAA1794 locus. These data add up to two conclusions. First, KIAA1794 is a FA gene. Second, this gene is identical to FANCI, since the patient cell lines found mutated in this study included the reference cell line for group I, EUFA592.","dc:creator":"Dorsman JC","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Identification of the Fanconi anemia complementation group I gene, FANCI."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17452773","rdfs:label":"EUFA695"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This male lacks complementation after hybridization with FA-I lymphoblasts; One variant is missense and the other results in an in-frame deletion of exon 27, encoding one of the SQE motifs.

A critical step in the activation of FA pathway is the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and its binding partner FANCI. To better address the clinical phenotype associated with FANCI and the epistatic relationship with FANCD2, we created the first conditional inactivation model for FANCI in mouse. Fanci -/- mice displayed typical FA features such as delayed development in utero, microphtalmia, cellular sensitivity to mitomycin C, occasional limb abnormalities and hematological deficiencies. Interestingly, the deletion of Fanci leads to a strong meiotic phenotype and severe hypogonadism. FANCI was localized in spermatocytes and spermatids and in the nucleus of oocytes. Both FANCI and FANCD2 proteins co-localized with RPA along meiotic chromosomes, albeit at different levels. Consistent with a role in meiotic recombination, FANCI interacted with RAD51 and stimulated D-loop formation, unlike FANCD2. The double knockout Fanci-/- Fancd2-/- also showed epistatic relationship for hematological defects while being not epistatic with respect to generating viable mice in crosses of double heterozygotes. Collectively, this study highlights common and distinct functions of FANCI and FANCD2 during mouse development, meiotic recombination and hematopoiesis.","dc:creator":"Dubois EL","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"A Fanci knockout mouse model reveals common and distinct functions for FANCI and FANCD2."},"rdfs:label":"Bone marrow hematopoiesis assays"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Fanci knockout mice displayed typical FA features such as delayed development in utero, microphtalmia, cellular sensitivity to mitomycin C, occasional limb abnormalities and hematological deficiencies.

The cellular hallmark of FA is hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents such as diepoxybutane (DEB) and mitomycin C (MMC), and high frequency of chromosomal aberrations. FANCD2 and FANCI form a protein complex (ID complex), their monoubiquitination is codependent and requires the FA core complex. FANCI was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Fanconi anemia complementation group I in 2007 [Dorsman JC et al., PMID: 17452773]. The genetic evidence provided here stems from three Fanconi anemia patient cohorts [PMID: 26590883, 17460694 and 17452773]. These patients are either homozygous or compound heterozygous for pathogenetic FANCI variants. Lymphoblasts from these patients showed absence or weak expression of FANCI protein, absence of FANCD2 monoubiquitination and hypersensitivity to mitomycin (MMC) exposure [PMID: 17452773]. Fanci mouse models (Fanci +/- and Fanci -/-) showed FA features such as delayed development in utero, microphthalmia, cellular sensitivity to mitomycin C, occasional limb abnormalities and hematological deficiencies. Embryonic lethality in Fanci -/- mice was observed (PMID: 31219578). Functional studies include extensive evidence of absent FANCD2 monoubiquitination and MMC hypersensitivity from FA patients’ lymphoblasts and from HeLa with FANCI specific siRNA transfection [PMID: 17460694]. In summary, FANCI is definitively associated with FA complementation group I. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a103db2f-a8b3-403b-993a-ac4215c118df"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
