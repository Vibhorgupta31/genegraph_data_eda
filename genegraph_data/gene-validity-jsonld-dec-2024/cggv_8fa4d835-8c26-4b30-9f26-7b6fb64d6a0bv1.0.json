The boy developed infantile-onset tonic-clonic and tonic seizures, then spasms in clusters. His electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a burst suppression pattern, leading to the diagnosis of Ohtahara syndrome. Whole-exome sequencing revealed the canonical splice-site variant (c.301 + 1 G > A) in NECAP1. In rodents, Necap1 protein is enriched in neuronal clathrin-coated vesicles and modulates synaptic vesicle recycling. cDNA analysis confirmed abnormal splicing that produced early truncating mRNA. There has been only one previous report of a mutation in NECAP1 in a family with EIEE; this was a nonsense mutation (p.R48*) that was cited as EIEE21. Decreased mRNA levels and the loss of the WXXF motif in both the families suggests that loss of NECAP1 function is a common pathomechanism for EIEE21. This study provided additional support that synaptic vesicle recycling plays a key role in epileptogenesis.","dc:creator":"Mizuguchi T","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"A novel homozygous truncating variant of NECAP1 in early infantile epileptic encephalopathy: the second case report of EIEE21."}},"rdfs:label":"30626896_Proband"},{"id":"cggv:2cfee36b-eab9-43e0-973a-7aacb98598af","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2cfee36b-eab9-43e0-973a-7aacb98598af_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:2cfee36b-eab9-43e0-973a-7aacb98598af_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"This variant is subject to nonsense-mediated decay, confirmed in patient-derived\nlymphoblast cells."}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f944e3a9-7429-46e3-ab61-ddaf2a301b61_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f944e3a9-7429-46e3-ab61-ddaf2a301b61","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:3ee8924e-8f42-4474-8195-710c16882dc0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015509.4(NECAP1):c.22G>A (p.Glu8Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA383795341"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0012758","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001250"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:9b5ad40f-7030-4fb1-8a96-df714f02f9e3_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3ee8924e-8f42-4474-8195-710c16882dc0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35638367","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Epileptic encephalopathy (EE) refers to a heterogeneous group of epilepsy syndromes characterized by seizures as well as encephalopathies, leading to cognitive and behavioral disturbances.

This condition is characterized by onset of seizures before 3 months of age, global developmental delay, and hypotonia. At least 3 variants (e.g. missense, splice, and nonsense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation, and experimental data. Summary of Case Level Data: 6.2 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 24399846, 30202406, 30525121, 30626896, 32552793, 35638367). Notably, four of these publications report individuals from Saudi Arabia with the same p.R48* founder variant. The GCEP capped the curation weight provided by this variant at 6 points to avoid over-interpreting its importance (this includes 3 points for variant interpretation and 3 points for segregation). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 5 additional affected family members. The mechanism for disease appears to be homozygous loss of function (PMID: 24399846, 30626896). This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function and protein interaction studies. NECAP1 has a role in Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, is essential to synaptic vesicle recycling, and which directly controls neuronal excitability (PMID: 35115907). While the biochemical role of NECAP1 is supportive of a role in seizures, it was not considered to be specific enough evidence to count towards clinical validity for the gene. The protein encoded by NECAP1 binds AP2 (PMID: 31430451) which is encoded by AP2M1 and is associated with seizures (PMID: 31104773). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCI on the meeting date January 17, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8fa4d835-8c26-4b30-9f26-7b6fb64d6a0b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
