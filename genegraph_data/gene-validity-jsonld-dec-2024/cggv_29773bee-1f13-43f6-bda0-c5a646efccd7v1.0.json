X-chromosomal hearing impairment represents only a minor fraction of all cases. In a study of a Spanish family the locus for one of the X-chromosomal forms was assigned to Xp22 (DFNX4). We mapped the disease locus in the same chromosomal region in a large German pedigree with X-chromosomal nonsyndromic hearing impairment by using genome-wide linkage analysis. Males presented with postlingual hearing loss and onset at ages 3-7, whereas onset in female carriers was in the second to third decades. Targeted DNA capture with high-throughput sequencing detected a nonsense mutation in the small muscle protein, X-linked (SMPX) of affected individuals. We identified another nonsense mutation in SMPX in patients from the Spanish family who were previously analyzed to map DFNX4. SMPX encodes an 88 amino acid, cytoskeleton-associated protein that is responsive to mechanical stress. The presence of Smpx in hair cells and supporting cells of the murine cochlea indicates its role in the inner ear. The nonsense mutations detected in the two families suggest a loss-of-function mechanism underlying this form of hearing impairment. Results obtained after heterologous overexpression of SMPX proteins were compatible with this assumption. Because responsivity to physical force is a characteristic feature of the protein, we propose that long-term maintenance of mechanically stressed inner-ear cells critically depends on SMPX function.","dc:creator":"Huebner AK","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Nonsense mutations in SMPX, encoding a protein responsive to physical force, result in X-chromosomal hearing loss."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21549336","rdfs:label":"Huebner_2 II-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Variant is absent from gnomAD."},{"id":"cggv:87ffaf4a-9c50-44ea-be9e-fedd43ef2bd2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ff43c9ac-7ef5-4d71-8d97-3aa3f640ec10","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"All 25 mutation carriers exhibited hearing impairment, except one woman aged 25 years.

For example, Smpx and Tekt2, which are regulators for cytoskeletal dynamics, were shown specifically expressed in the hair cells, suggesting a possible role in hair cell differentiation or function. Here, by reanalyzing archived genetic profiling data, we identified a list of novel genes possibly involved in hair cell differentiation.","dc:creator":"Yoon H","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Identification of genes concordantly expressed with Atoh1 during inner ear development."},"rdfs:label":"Genes expressed concordantly with Atoh1 during inner ear dev"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:da0bd6b8-abdd-46d3-bf2f-2f4a0ee33c87","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1f2e826b-8067-4628-ba8b-84ecf79c3b46","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Eurexpress database assay 006968 and Genepaint assay DC27 shows that SMPX is expressed in the inner ear of embryonic mice.

Variants in SMPX were first reported in humans with the disease as early as 2011 (Schraders et al., 21549342). At least six variants, nonsense and frameshift, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported at least 8 probands in 5 publications (21549342, 21549336, 21893181, 22911656, 28542515). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in >100 additional family members. The families studied display an expected-X linked inheritance pattern where the hearing loss is earlier onset and more profound in males and slightly less penetrant in females. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies. Loss of function of SMPX is expected to impact the ability of inner ear hair cells to conduct sound. It is important to note that there were SMPX null mice generated to investigate the effect of the deletion on muscle organization and function, however hearing loss was not studied in these mice (Palmer et al. 2001). In summary, SMPX is definitively associated with X-linked nonsyndromic hearing loss. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 9/12/17.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:29773bee-1f13-43f6-bda0-c5a646efccd7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
