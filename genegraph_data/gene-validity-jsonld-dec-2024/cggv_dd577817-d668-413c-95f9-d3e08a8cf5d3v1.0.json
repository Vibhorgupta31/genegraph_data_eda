A loss-of-function mutation of ankyrin-B identified in an extended kindred causes a dominantly inherited cardiac arrhythmia, initially described as type 4 long QT syndrome. Here we report the identification of eight unrelated probands harboring ankyrin-B loss-of-function mutations, including four previously undescribed mutations, whose clinical features distinguish the cardiac phenotype associated with loss of ankyrin-B activity from classic long QT syndromes. Humans with ankyrin-B mutations display varying degrees of cardiac dysfunction including bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and risk of sudden death. However, a prolonged rate-corrected QT interval was not a consistent feature, indicating that ankyrin-B dysfunction represents a clinical entity distinct from classic long QT syndromes. The mutations are localized in the ankyrin-B regulatory domain, which distinguishes function of ankyrin-B from ankyrin-G in cardiomyocytes. All mutations abolish ability of ankyrin-B to restore abnormal Ca(2+) dynamics and abnormal localization and expression of Na/Ca exchanger, Na/K ATPase, and InsP(3)R in ankyrin-B(+/-) cardiomyocytes. This study, considered together with the first description of ankyrin-B mutation associated with cardiac dysfunction, supports a previously undescribed paradigm for human disease due to abnormal coordination of multiple functionally related ion channels and transporters, in this case the Na/K ATPase, Na/Ca exchanger, and InsP(3) receptor.","dc:creator":"Mohler PJ","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"A cardiac arrhythmia syndrome caused by loss of ankyrin-B function."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue in mice heterozygous for a null mutation in ANK2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0cbc743b-aa65-47c3-bd4a-dfd33204fc77","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6cc2430f-5d9d-4388-9809-a3281df8a9e0","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Mis-sorting of SERCA 2 and ryanodine receptor 2 in ankyrin-B (-/-) cardiomyocytes is rescued by expression of 220-kD ankyrin-B, demonstrating that lack of the 220-kD ankyrin-B polypeptide is the primary defect in these cells.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10579720","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"This report describes a congenital myopathy and major loss of thymic lymphocytes in ankyrin-B (-/-) mice as well as dramatic alterations in intracellular localization of key components of the Ca(2+) homeostasis machinery in ankyrin-B (-/-) striated muscle and thymus. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and SR/T-tubule junctions are apparently preserved in a normal distribution in ankyrin-B (-/-) skeletal muscle based on electron microscopy and the presence of a normal pattern of triadin and dihydropyridine receptor. Therefore, the abnormal localization of SR/ER Ca ATPase (SERCA) and ryanodine receptors represents a defect in intracellular sorting of these proteins in skeletal muscle. Extrapolation of these observations suggests defective targeting as the basis for abnormal localization of ryanodine receptors, IP3 receptors and SERCA in heart, and of IP3 receptors in the thymus of ankyrin-B (-/-) mice. Mis-sorting of SERCA 2 and ryanodine receptor 2 in ankyrin-B (-/-) cardiomyocytes is rescued by expression of 220-kD ankyrin-B, demonstrating that lack of the 220-kD ankyrin-B polypeptide is the primary defect in these cells. Ankyrin-B is associated with intracellular vesicles, but is not colocalized with the bulk of SERCA 1 or ryanodine receptor type 1 in skeletal muscle. These data provide the first evidence of a physiological requirement for ankyrin-B in intracellular targeting of the calcium homeostasis machinery of striated muscle and immune system, and moreover, support a catalytic role that does not involve permanent stoichiometric complexes between ankyrin-B and targeted proteins. Ankyrin-B is a member of a family of adapter proteins implicated in restriction of diverse proteins to specialized plasma membrane domains.

Although no novel commonly mutated gene was identified other than known LQTS genes, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses revealed ten new pathogenic candidates that directly or indirectly interact with proteins encoded by known LQTS genes. Furthermore, candidate gene based association studies using an independent set of 138 unrelated LQTS cases and 587 controls identified an additional novel candidate. Together, mutations in these new candidates and known genes explained 37.1% of the LQTS families (13 in 35). Moreover, half of the newly identified candidates directly interact with calmodulin (5 in 11; comparison with all genes; p=0.042). Subsequent variant analysis in the independent set of 138 cases identified 16 variants in the 11 genes, of which 14 were in calmodulin-interacting genes (87.5%). These results suggest an important role of calmodulin and its interacting proteins in the pathogenesis of LQTS.","dc:creator":"Shigemizu D","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Exome Analyses of Long QT Syndrome Reveal Candidate Pathogenic Mutations in Calmodulin-Interacting Genes."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26132555","rdfs:label":"LQT4 - 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:25076235-7738-4cf3-af04-55783ab5e4ff_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bfc1bb93-19fc-45c7-aa8d-b85c76fe2b09","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":24,"detectionMethod":"All exons of ankyrin-B (Ank2), with exception of brain-specific exon 38, were screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) or by denaturing HPLC, and DNA sequence analyses.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"SSCP","phenotypeFreeText":"Prolonged T interval and torsades de pointes","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001657","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"No mutation in KCNQ1, HERG, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNJ2.","secondTestingMethod":"Denaturing gradient gel","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:25076235-7738-4cf3-af04-55783ab5e4ff_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:2b27ebd8-e5d1-4add-b2cc-33f06a71d0f1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001148.6(ANK2):c.11791G>A (p.Glu3931Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA145040"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15178757"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15178757","rdfs:label":"Patient 1 with the E1813K mutation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"MAF 0.019 in Ashkenazi Jews"},{"id":"cggv:33c9b8ab-0087-446c-8603-4722fcaa4945_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:40e3c5b2-a884-422c-81ed-c7e71693fc89","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":37,"detectionMethod":"All exons of ankyrin-B (Ank2), with exception of brain-specific exon 38, were screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) or by denaturing HPLC, and DNA sequence analyses.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"SSCP","phenotypeFreeText":"Prolonged QT interval and torsades de pointes","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001657","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"No mutation was found in KCNQ1, HERG, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNJ2.","secondTestingMethod":"Denaturing gradient gel","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:33c9b8ab-0087-446c-8603-4722fcaa4945_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:c46df0b0-7c09-4f59-a1df-068897edc470","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001148.6(ANK2):c.11716C>T (p.Arg3906Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA127768"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15178757"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15178757","rdfs:label":"Patient 1 with the R1788W mutation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"MAF 0.0019 in Europeans"},{"id":"cggv:88630ad8-45cc-48bc-a7b5-5eba907b52c7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:59f96c4b-19c0-4893-a5b5-482ee73b83dc","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":36,"detectionMethod":"WES + sanger confirmation","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Admitted in emergency hospital for nausea and vomiting: lost consciousness because of TdPs.QTc 597ms.

Despite many advances, a genetic diagnosis still cannot be established in 25-30% of patients. The aim of the present study was to perform genetic evaluation in 9 Russian families with LQTS; here we report the results of 4 positive probands and their relatives (a total of 16 individuals). All subjects underwent clinical examination, 12-lead ECG, and Holter monitoring. Genetic analysis of the 14 genes mainly involved in LQTS was performed using a next-generation sequencing approach. We identified two new mutations (KCNQ1 gene) and 6 known mutations (AKAP9, ANK2, KCNE1 and KCNJ2 genes) in 4 out of 9 probands, some of which have already been described in association with LQTS. Segregation studies suggest a possible causative role for KCNQ1 p.(Leu342Pro), AKAP9 p.(Arg1609Lys), KCNE1 p.(Asp85Asn), and KCNJ2 p.(Arg82Gln) variations. Our study confirmed the high genetic heterogeneity of this disease and highlights the difficulties to reveal clear pathogenic genotypes also in large pedigrees.

This gene is located within a very large (~16 million bp) region identified by linkage analysis in a large family with LQTS (PMID 7485162). Subsequent sequencing of ANK2 in members of this family identified a missense variant (p.Glu1458Gly) that at time of publication (2003, PMID 12571597) was thought to be pathogenic. Contemporary data, however, demonstrates this variant has a population frequency too high for an autosomal dominant cause of LQTS (~1:400 individuals of Latino ancestry). Due to lack of other segregation data or case-control data and paucity of additional genetic and experimental data, this gene-disease association was classified as disputed.\nNote: All LQTS genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams was reviewed by the LQTS Clinical Domain Working Group. The classification and summary presented here is the conclusion of this Working Group's analysis according to evidence available at time of publication. The scores presented here are the result of only one of the three curation teams' efforts. For a detailed discussion of this group's work and the scores of all 3 teams please see \"Adler et al.
