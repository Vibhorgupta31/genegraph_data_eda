Heterozygous LBR mutations cause nuclear hyposegmentation in neutrophils (Pelger anomaly), while homozygous mutations cause prenatal death with skeletal defects and abnormal sterol metabolism (Greenberg dysplasia). It has remained unclear whether the lethality in Greenberg dysplasia is due to cholesterol defects or altered nuclear morphology.To answer this question we characterized two LBR missense mutations and showed that they cause Greenberg dysplasia. Both mutations affect residues that are evolutionary conserved among sterol reductases. In contrast to wildtype LBR, both mutations failed to rescue C14 sterol reductase deficient yeast, indicating an enzymatic defect. We found no Pelger anomaly in the carrier parent excluding marked effects on nuclear structure. We studied Lbr in mouse embryos and demonstrate expression in skin and the developing skeletal system consistent with sites of histological changes in Greenberg dysplasia. Unexpectedly we found in disease-relevant cell types not only nuclear but also cytoplasmatic LBR localization. The cytoplasmatic LBR staining co-localized with ER-markers and is thus consistent with the sites of endogeneous sterol synthesis. We conclude that LBR missense mutations can abolish sterol reductase activity, causing lethal Greenberg dysplasia but not Pelger anomaly. The findings separate the metabolic from the structural function and indicate that the sterol reductase activity is essential for human intrauterine development.","dc:creator":"Clayton P","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutations causing Greenberg dysplasia but not Pelger anomaly uncouple enzymatic from structural functions of a nuclear membrane protein."}},"rdfs:label":"Clayton_Fetus A"},{"id":"cggv:2907284a-53f9-4a24-bfc1-ad3af83537fb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2907284a-53f9-4a24-bfc1-ad3af83537fb_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Score downgraded 0.5 points for consanguinity and 0.5 for homozygosity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:cd334067-fc3c-4999-80f0-a3ef694b29b4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd334067-fc3c-4999-80f0-a3ef694b29b4","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:457c915a-182a-42a2-8143-a26c14f68431","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002296.4(LBR):c.1639A>G (p.Asn547Asp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA150660"}},"detectionMethod":"LBR sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion was performed to determine the variant ","firstTestingMethod":"Restriction digest","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0010659","obo:HP_0005257","obo:HP_0001789","obo:HP_0002240","obo:HP_0002983","obo:HP_0003026"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:5bc8d4ab-014d-43c0-b417-3252adf45c05_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:457c915a-182a-42a2-8143-a26c14f68431"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18382993","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Greenberg skeletal dysplasia is a very rare, autosomal recessive, in utero, lethal chondrodystrophy for which only eight index cases of diverse ethnic origin have been reported so far.

Greenberg Skeletal Dysplasia is a prenatally lethal chondrodystrophy, characterized by fetal hydrops, short limbs, and abnormal chondro-osseous calcification. Variants in LBR have been reported in individuals with the following disease entities: Reynold’s syndrome, Greenberg Skeletal Dysplasia, Pelger-Huet anomaly, and Regressive Spondylometaphyseal Dysplasia. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into four disease entities, Reynold’s syndrome (OMIM:613471), Greenberg Skeletal Dysplasia (OMIM:215140), Pelger-Huet anomaly (OMIM:169400), and Regressive Spondylometaphyseal Dysplasia (OMIM:618019). The split curation for AR Regressive Spondylometaphyseal Dysplasia has been curated separately by the Skeletal Disorders GCEP. Three missense variants, three frameshift, and one indel variants that have been reported in six probands in five publications (PMIDs: 12618959, 18382993, 21327084, 30518689, 30561119) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression evidence (PMID: 21327084). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
