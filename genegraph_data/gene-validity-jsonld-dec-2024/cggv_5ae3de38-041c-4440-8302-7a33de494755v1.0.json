In contrast to their dominant counterparts, unraveling the molecular background of these ataxias has proven to be more complicated and the currently known mutations provide incomplete coverage for genotyping of patients. By combining SNP array-based linkage analysis and targeted resequencing of relevant sequences in the linkage interval with the use of next-generation sequencing technology, we identified a mutation in a gene and have shown its association with autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxia. In a Dutch consanguineous family with three affected siblings a homozygous 12.5 Mb region on chromosome 3 was targeted by array-based sequence capture. Prioritization of all detected sequence variants led to four candidate genes, one of which contained a variant with a high base pair conservation score (phyloP score: 5.26). This variant was a leucine-to-arginine substitution in the DUF 590 domain of a 16K transmembrane protein, a putative calcium-activated chloride channel encoded by anoctamin 10 (ANO10). The analysis of ANO10 by Sanger sequencing revealed three additional mutations: a homozygous mutation (c.1150_1151del [p.Leu384fs]) in a Serbian family and a compound-heterozygous splice-site mutation (c.1476+1G>T) and a frameshift mutation (c.1604del [p.Leu535X]) in a French family. This illustrates the power of using initial homozygosity mapping with next-generation sequencing technology to identify genes involved in autosomal-recessive diseases. Moreover, identifying a putative calcium-dependent chloride channel involved in cerebellar ataxia adds another pathway to the list of pathophysiological mechanisms that may cause cerebellar ataxia.","dc:creator":"Vermeer S","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Targeted next-generation sequencing of a 12.5 Mb homozygous region reveals ANO10 mutations in patients with autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5ae3de38-041c-4440-8302-7a33de494755_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5ae3de38-041c-4440-8302-7a33de494755_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0ee5c3a8-0bc3-4642-a3a1-c5e60e4fc9f6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e43dba82-88e6-4afe-8c59-fa33e9f22ddf","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"ANO10 has the highest expression in the brain, as shown by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Figure 3A), with highest expression levels in the frontal and occipital cortices and in the cerebellum (Figure 3B).

Numerous genetic disorders have been associated with chronic progressive ataxia and this consequently presents a diagnostic challenge for the clinician regarding how to approach and prioritize genetic testing in patients with such clinically heterogeneous phenotypes. Additionally, while the value of genetic testing in early-onset and/or familial cases seems clear, many patients with ataxia present sporadically with adult onset of symptoms and the contribution of genetic variation to the phenotype of these patients has not yet been established.","dc:creator":"Fogel BL","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Exome sequencing in the clinical diagnosis of sporadic or familial cerebellar ataxia."}},"rdfs:label":"Fogel Proband ATX9"},{"id":"cggv:85cd63a3-0562-4432-af60-9b5e45171d02","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:85cd63a3-0562-4432-af60-9b5e45171d02_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This frameshift variant, Asp45fs in exon 2/13, is present in gnomAD v4.1.0 with a MAF=0.0008157 (946/1159730 alleles) in the European NF population with 0 homozygotes."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5ae3de38-041c-4440-8302-7a33de494755_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":11.2},{"id":"cggv:8c8e689a-9bb1-44f7-95e8-78e03630e690_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8c8e689a-9bb1-44f7-95e8-78e03630e690","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":42,"allele":{"id":"cggv:66b44132-edac-465b-ab95-0ca3772bfb3d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018075.5(ANO10):c.609C>G (p.Tyr203Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA352344350"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Mini-Mental State Examination score was 29. brain stem was slightly atrophic.

The *ANO10* gene is a member of the anoctamin family and encodes a transmembrane protein that has various functions including phospholipid scrambling, chloride channel activity, and calcium signaling (PMID: 35648332). Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia due to variants in *ANO10* is characterized by gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, and cerebellar atrophy on brain imaging (PMID: 21092923). Other features may be present as well and age of onset is variable (PMID: 36698452).\n\nSix variants (2 nonsense, 2 frameshift, 1 missense, 1 canonical splice-site) that have been reported in 5 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 21092923, 23551081, 25133958) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including alteration of calcium signaling in mouse intestinal epithelial cells (PMID: 27838374), alteration of endosomal retrograde transport in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PMID: 32620747), and a knockout mouse model displaying impairment of neuromuscular function (PMID: 32620747).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *ANO10* and autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebellar Ataxia GCEP on the meeting date December 11, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5ae3de38-041c-4440-8302-7a33de494755"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
