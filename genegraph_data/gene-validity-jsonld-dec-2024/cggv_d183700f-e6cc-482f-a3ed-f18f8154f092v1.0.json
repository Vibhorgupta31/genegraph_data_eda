Affected individuals from two unrelated Bedouin Israeli kindreds were studied. Brain imaging demonstrated diffuse cerebellar atrophy and abnormal iron deposition in the medial and lateral globus pallidum. Progressive white-matter disease and reduction of the N-acetyl aspartate : chromium ratio were evident on magnetic resonance spectroscopy, suggesting loss of myelination. The clinical and radiological diagnosis of INAD was verified by sural nerve biopsy. The disease gene was mapped to a 1.17-Mb locus on chromosome 22q13.1 (LOD score 4.7 at recombination fraction 0 for SNP rs139897), and an underlying mutation common to both affected families was identified in PLA2G6, the gene encoding phospholipase A2 group VI (cytosolic, calcium-independent).

To clarify the pathomechanism of INAD, we pathologically analyzed the spinal cords and sciatic nerves of iPLA(2)β knock-out (KO) mice, a model of INAD. At 15 weeks (preclinical stage), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive granules were frequently observed in proximal axons and the perinuclear space of large neurons, and these were strongly positive for a marker of the mitochondrial outer membrane and negative for a marker of the inner membrane. By 100 weeks (late clinical stage), PAS-positive granules and spheroids had increased significantly in the distal parts of axons, and ultrastructural examination revealed that these granules were, in fact, mitochondria with degenerative inner membranes. Collapse of mitochondria in axons was accompanied by focal disappearance of the cytoskeleton. Partial membrane loss at axon terminals was also evident, accompanied by degenerative membranes in the same areas. Imaging mass spectrometry showed a prominent increase of docosahexaenoic acid-containing phosphatidylcholine in the gray matter, suggesting insufficient membrane remodeling in the presence of iPLA(2)β deficiency. Prominent axonal degeneration in neuroaxonal dystrophy might be explained by the collapse of abnormal mitochondria after axonal transportation.

PLAN is a continuum of three phenotypes with overlapping clinical and radiological features: (1) infantile neuronal dystrophy (INAD) or NBIA2A (OMIM: 256600), (2) atypical neuronal dystrophy (ANAD) with childhood-onset or NBIA2B (OMIM: 610217), (3) adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism form named PARK14 (OMIM: 612953), to possibly a certain subtype of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (Deng et al. 2023. PMID: 37236368). INAD, or NBIA2A, usually begins between ages six months and three years with rapid progression, characterized by psychomotor regression or delay, hypotonia, progressive spastic tetraparesis, and visual impairment. Many affected children do not survive beyond their first decade. ANAD, or NBIA2B, shows more phenotypic variability than INAD and may present in early childhood but can be as late as the end of the second decade. The presenting signs may be speech delay, gait instability, ataxia, postural instability, dystonia, spasticity, and cognitive decline with autistic features. Strabismus, nystagmus, and optic atrophy are common. PARK14, or *PLA2G6*-related dystonia-parkinsonism, has a variable age of onset, but most individuals present gait disturbance or neuropsychiatric changes and develop dystonia and parkinsonism (bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability) in their late teens to early twenties. Cerebellar atrophy is a typical radiological sign which correlates with the severity of the phenotype. Another common feature, iron accumulation within the globus pallidum and substantia nigra are variable and does not correlate with the severity of the phenotype (Gregory et al. GeneReviews, PMID: 20301718, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1675/).\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in inheritance pattern AND pathological phenotypes. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: NBIA2A (OMIM: 256600), NBIA2B (OMIM: 610217), autosomal recessive Parkinson disease 14 (OMIM: 612953), to possibly a certain subtype of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP).\n\nTo date, 217 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in *PLA2G6* (OMIM: 603604) including missense or nonsense variants, splicing variants, small insertions/deletions, multi-exon deletion, and copy number variations have been submitted to ClinVar. This curation includes 13 variants from 10 probands in one publication (Morgan et al. 2006. PMID: 16783378). These variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) have also been reported in other probands in 26 publications (PMIDs: 28097321, 18799783, 22934738, 19138334, 29859652, 20619503, 29395073, 18359254, 24745848, 33101984, 32860008, 20886109, 25164370, 29482223, 24108619, 20619503, 29915382, 30772976, 34622992, 31548400, 28097321, 17033970, 24628589, 28714225, 34272103, 27196560). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. This includes the biochemical function of the gene product, which is consistent with the features observed in human patients. *PLA2G6* encodes a calcium-independent group VI phospholipase A2, iPLA2β, which localizes to the neuronal mitochondria and endosomal and lysosomal membranes. In the nervous system, iPLA2β may be involved in membrane homeostasis, signal transduction, mitochondrial dysfunction, and α-synuclein aggregation (Zhou et al. 2016. PMID: 26755131; Malley et al. 2018. PMID: 29472584; Deng et al, 2023, PMID: 37236368). In addition, non-human animal models Knock out mice, Drosophila) recapitulate the clinical and histopathological features of the disease (Malik et al. 2008. PMID: 18202189; Beck et al. 2008. PMID: 21813701; Zhao et al. 2011. PMID: 22046428) and a *Drosophila *model (Lin et al. 2018. PMID: 29909971) (Experimental evidence – 6 points).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *PLA2G6* and *PLA2G6*-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN), an autosomal recessive disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 21, 2024 (SOP v10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d183700f-e6cc-482f-a3ed-f18f8154f092"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
