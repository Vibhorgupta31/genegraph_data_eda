More than 50% of the cases of profound early-onset deafness are caused by genetic factors. Over 40 loci for non-syndromic deafness have been genetically mapped, and mutations in several genes have been shown to cause hearing loss. Mutations in the gene encoding connexin 26 (GJB2) cause both autosomal recessive and dominant forms of hearing impairment. To study the possible involvement of other members of the connexin family in hereditary hearing impairment, we cloned the gene (GJB3) encoding human gap junction protein beta-3 using homologous EST searching and nested PCR. GJB3 was mapped to human chromosome 1p33-p35. Mutation analysis revealed that a missense mutation and a nonsense mutation of GJB3 were associated with high-frequency hearing loss in two families. Moreover, expression of Gjb3 was identified in rat inner ear tissue by RT-PCR. These findings suggest that mutations in GJB3 may be responsible for bilateral high-frequency hearing impairment.","dc:creator":"Xia JH","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Mutations in the gene encoding gap junction protein beta-3 associated with autosomal dominant hearing impairment."},"rdfs:label":"Xia Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:9c58c190-7940-44a9-abb9-a956286f47ce","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:076bbc7b-f4a2-4fe0-92a6-d9687b54cb9f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"GJB3 expressed in mouse cochlea by in situ hybridization","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11309368","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in the connexin 31 (GJB3) gene have been found in subjects with dominant and recessive deafness and in patients with erythrokeratodermia variabilis.

All the 380 Taiwanese were screened for the presence of mutations in 8 genes of the Cx gene family. These genes included Cx26 (GJB2), Cx29 (GJE1), Cx30 (GJB6), Cx30.3 (GJB4), Cx31 (GJB3), Cx32 (GJB1), Cx43 (GJA1) and pseudogene [rho] of Cx43 (rho GJA1).

Fourteen polymorphisms that were not associated with hearing loss were identified in the Cx gene family. The first 2 most frequently occurring mutations were found in the Cx26 (28/62; 45.16%) and the rho Cx43 (17/62; 27.42%), respectively. Nine cases of mutations were found in the Cx30.3 (9/62; 14.52%).

Audiograms were derived from all patients to characterize audiological features of GJB2 mutations especially. In 59 patients (31.3%) of the 188 probands, the hearing impairment was due to GJB2 mutations, 45 (23.9%) of these being homozygous for 35delG mutation and 14 (7.4%) compound heterozygous for GJB2 mutations in the coding region of exon 2 whereas no significant sequence variation was found in exon 1.

Gap junctions are intercellular communication channels and important factors that are associated with hearing loss. To date, a molecular genetics study of GJB3 and GJB6 as a causative gene for hearing loss has not been performed in Korea. This study was therefore performed to elucidate the genetic characteristics of Korean patients with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss and to determine the pathological mechanism of hearing loss by analyzing the intercellular communication function of Cx30 and Cx31 variants. Sequencing analysis of the GJB3 and GJB6 genes in our population revealed a total of nine variants, including four novel variants in the two genes. Three of the novel variants (Cx31-p.V27M, Cx31-p.V43M and Cx-30-p.I248V) and two previously reported variants (Cx31-p.V84I and Cx30-p.A40V) were selected for functional studies using a pathogenicity prediction program and assessed for whether the mutations were located in a conserved region of the protein. The results of biochemical and ionic coupling tests showed that both the Cx31-p.V27M and Cx31-p.V84I variants did not function normally when each was expressed as a heterozygote with the wild-type Cx31.

in genes encoding gap- and tight-junction proteins have been shown to cause distinct forms of hearing loss. We have now determined the GJB2[connexin 26 (Cx26)] mutation spectrum in 60 index patients from mostly large Turkish families with autosomal-recessive inherited non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSSHL). GJB2 mutations were found in 31.7% of the families, and the GJB2-35delG mutation accounted for 73.6% of all GJB2 mutations. The carrier frequency of GJB2-35delG in the normal Turkish population was found to be 1.17% (five in 429). In addition to the described W24X, 233delC, 120delE and R127H mutations, we also identified a novel mutation, Q80R, in the GJB2 gene. Interestingly, the Q80R allele was inherited on the same haplotype as V27I and E114G polymorphisms. As little is known about the mutation frequencies of most other recently identified gap- and tight-junction genes as a cause for hearing loss, we further screened our patients for mutations in GJB3 (Cx31), GJA1 (Cx43), DeltaGJB6-D13S1830 (Cx30) and the gene encoding the tight-junction protein, claudin 14 (CLDN14). Several novel polymorphisms, but no disease-associated mutations, were identified in the CLND14 and GJA1 genes, and we were unable to detect the DeltaGJB6-D13S1830 deletion. A novel putative mutation, P223T, was found in the GJB3 gene in heterozygous form in a family with two affected children. Our data shows that the frequency of GJB2 mutations in Turkish patients with autosomal-recessive NSSHL and the carrier rate of the GJB2-35delG mutation in the Turkish population, is much lower than described for other Mediterranean countries. Furthermore, mutations in other gap- and tight-junction proteins are not a frequent cause of hearing loss in Turkey.","dc:creator":"Uyguner O","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Frequencies of gap- and tight-junction mutations in Turkish families with autosomal-recessive non-syndromic hearing loss."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12791041","rdfs:label":"Uyguner Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Variant present in 0.1% of Other alleles in gnomAD.

This association was made using case-level data only. Multiple missense and nonsense variants have been reported in humans, however many of these variants are present in high frequency in population databases and/or have no evidence for pathogenicity. 3 variants were considered to have enough evidence to score. GJB3 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1998 (Xia et al.). Association is seen in at least 5 probands in 3 publications (12759707, 19744334, 22617145). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies in rat and mouse cochlea. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Erythrokeratodermia variabilis. This has been assessed separately. In summary, there is convincing evidence disputing the association between GJB3 and autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. More evidence is needed to either support or refute the role GJB3 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 2/27/2018.\nAn additional 0.5 point awarded to Yuan 2009 Proband 1, however variant is not supported by ClinVar or Allele Registry. The Hearing Loss Expert Panel concluded that this association is Disputed, due to lack of convincing evidence of an association.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f83e013a-685f-405b-89d6-a8e80aefaf6e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
