A genetic cause for the disorder is present in a majority of the cases. We mapped a locus (DFNB101) for hearing loss in humans to chromosome 5q in a consanguineous Pakistani family. Exome sequencing revealed an insertion mutation in GRXCR2 as the cause of moderate-to-severe and likely progressive hearing loss in the affected individuals of the family. The frameshift mutation is predicted to affect a conserved, cysteine-rich region of GRXCR2, and to result in an abnormal extension of the C-terminus. Functional studies by cell transfections demonstrated that the mutant protein is unstable and mislocalized relative to wild-type GRXCR2, consistent with a loss-of-function mutation. Targeted disruption of Grxcr2 is concurrently reported to cause hearing loss in mice. The structural abnormalities in this animal model suggest a role for GRXCR2 in the development of stereocilia bundles, specialized structures on the apical surface of sensory cells in the cochlea that are critical for sound detection. Our results indicate that GRXCR2 should be considered in differential genetic diagnosis for individuals with early onset, moderate-to-severe and progressive hearing loss.

Variations in SLC26A4 and GJB2 in 28 children with bilateral severe-to-profound non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) without familial history were analyzed using Sanger sequencing. Genetic analysis of individuals without mutations in SLC26A4 and GJB2 was performed by whole exome sequencing (WES). Bi-allelic mutations in SLC26A4 and GJB2 were identified in 12 and 3 subjects, respectively. Of the 13 individuals without mutations in SLC26A4 and GJB2, 2 and 1 carried compound heterozygous mutations in MYO15A and CDH23, respectively. Thus, 64.3% (18/28) of individuals with NSHL were determined to be genetically predisposed. Individuals with sporadic severe-to-profound NSHL were found to mostly exhibit an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Novel causative candidate genes for NSHL were identified by analysis of WES data of 10 families without mutations in known causative genes. Bi-allelic mutations predisposing to NSHL were identified in 64.3% of subjects with sporadic severe-to-profound NSHL. Given that several causative genes for NSHL are still unidentified, genetic inheritance of sporadic congenital hearing loss could be more common than that indicated by our results.","dc:creator":"Jung J","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Genetic Predisposition to Sporadic Congenital Hearing Loss in a Pediatric Population."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28383030","rdfs:label":"Jung Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This variant/proband is scored zero points because the GRXCR2 variant is heterozygous in this individual.

We found that mouse GRXCR2 localizes to the base of the stereocilia, which are actin-based mechanosensing organelles in cochlear hair cells that convert sound-induced vibrations into electrical signals. The stereocilia base also contains taperin, another protein of unknown function required for human hearing. We show that taperin and GRXCR2 form a complex and that taperin is diffused throughout the stereocilia length in Grxcr2-deficient hair cells. Stereocilia lacking GRXCR2 are longer than normal and disorganized due to the mislocalization of taperin, which could modulate the actin cytoskeleton in stereocilia. Remarkably, reducing taperin expression levels could rescue the morphological defects of stereocilia and restore the hearing of Grxcr2-deficient mice. Thus, our findings suggest that GRXCR2 is critical for the morphogenesis of stereocilia and auditory perception by restricting taperin to the stereocilia base.","dc:creator":"Liu C","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"GRXCR2 Regulates Taperin Localization Critical for Stereocilia Morphology and Hearing."},"rdfs:label":"Stereocilia expression of GRXCR2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:64135210-3ab2-4ec4-b72c-377149831a18","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:878dfb3a-efef-4113-8c17-c34c0b3d152a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"RT-PCR analysis of mice missing exon 1 of GRXCR2 and heterozygous mice showed that heterozygous and WT mice expressed GRXCR2 in the sterocilia of the cochlea while KO mice did not have full length transcripts of GRXCR2 and exhibited disorganized sterocilia","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30157177","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hearing and balance depend upon the precise morphogenesis and mechanosensory function of stereocilia, the specialized structures on the apical surface of sensory hair cells in the inner ear. Previous studies of Grxcr1 mutant mice indicated a critical role for this gene in control of stereocilia dimensions during development. In this study, we analyzed expression of the paralog Grxcr2 in the mouse and evaluated auditory and vestibular function of strains carrying targeted mutations of the gene. Peak expression of Grxcr2 occurs during early postnatal development of the inner ear and GRXCR2 is localized to stereocilia in both the cochlea and in vestibular organs. Homozygous Grxcr2 deletion mutants exhibit significant hearing loss by 3 weeks of age that is associated with developmental defects in stereocilia bundle orientation and organization. Despite these bundle defects, the mechanotransduction apparatus assembles in relatively normal fashion as determined by whole cell electrophysiological evaluation and FM1-43 uptake. Although Grxcr2 mutants do not exhibit overt vestibular dysfunction, evaluation of vestibular evoked potentials revealed subtle defects of the mutants in response to linear accelerations. In addition, reduced Grxcr2 expression in a hypomorphic mutant strain is associated with progressive hearing loss and bundle defects. The stereocilia localization of GRXCR2, together with the bundle pathologies observed in the mutants, indicate that GRXCR2 plays an intrinsic role in bundle orientation, organization, and sensory function in the inner ear during development and at maturity.","dc:creator":"Avenarius MR","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Grxcr2 is required for stereocilia morphogenesis in the cochlea."},"rdfs:label":"GRXCR2 cochlear expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:f88c7355-b124-4052-8a16-33a01957ce3f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6c26599c-2b0f-4169-8b50-358793464122","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"This study showed that GRXCR2 forms a complex with TPRN by geneticlaly engineering mice (using CRISPR cas9) that were TPRN deficient, GRXCR2 deficient, or both TPRN deficient and GRXCR2 deficient.
