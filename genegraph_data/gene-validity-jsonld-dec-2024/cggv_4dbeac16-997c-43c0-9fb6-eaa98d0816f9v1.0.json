While eight IL-21R-deficient patients have been reported previously, the natural course, immune characteristics of disease, and response to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remain to be comprehensively examined. In our study, we have collected clinical histories of 13 patients with IL-21R deficiency from eight families across seven centers worldwide, including five novel patients identified by exome or NGS panel sequencing. Eight unique mutations in IL21R were identified in these patients, including two novel mutations. Median age at disease onset was 2.5 years (0.5-7 years). The main clinical manifestations were recurrent bacterial (84.6%), fungal (46.2%), and viral (38.5%) infections; cryptosporidiosis-associated cholangitis (46.2%); and asthma (23.1%). Inflammatory skin diseases (15.3%) and recurrent anaphylaxis (7.9%) constitute novel phenotypes of this combined immunodeficiency. Most patients exhibited hypogammaglobulinemia and reduced proportions of memory B cells, circulating T follicular helper cells, MAIT cells and terminally differentiated NK cells. However, IgE levels were elevated in 50% of IL-21R-deficient patients. Overall survival following HSCT (6 patients, mean follow-up 1.8 year) was 33.3%, with pre-existing organ damage constituting a negative prognostic factor. Mortality of non-transplanted patients (n = 7) was 57.1%. Our detailed analysis of the largest cohort of IL-21R-deficient patients to date provides in-depth clinical, immunological and immunophenotypic features of these patients, thereby establishing critical non-redundant functions of IL-21/IL-21R signaling in lymphocyte differentiation, humoral immunity and host defense against infection, and mechanisms of disease pathogenesis due to IL-21R deficiency. Outcome following HSCT depends on prior chronic infections and organ damage, which should thus be considered as early as possible following molecular diagnosis.","dc:creator":"Cagdas D","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Genomic Spectrum and Phenotypic Heterogeneity of Human IL-21 Receptor Deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Functional defects in B and T cells "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:9154fca2-e219-4b46-b3b7-83c63dc6e54a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3ab736f1-cba2-43c6-aefc-50708b976cc9","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Within the contracted memory B cell population in IL-21R-deficient patients, proportions of IgG+ or IgA+ switched cells were significantly decreased\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33929673","rdfs:label":"Impaired generation of memory B cells "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:4dbeac16-997c-43c0-9fb6-eaa98d0816f9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:54d5c549-edda-48bd-9cf4-51fb5ffba05a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd07222a-b681-42bd-9329-6cca45e23d6e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Both Sustained Treg defect and absence of B cell differentiation could be recapitulated in the animal model.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24446516","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The cytokine IL-21 has been shown to influence immune responses through both costimulatory effects on effector T cells and opposing inhibitory effects on T regulatory cells (Tregs).

Our findings demonstrate that in the absence of IL-21/IL-21R signaling, Il2(-/-) mice retained a deficiency in Tregs yet exhibited a reduced and delayed inflammatory disease. The improved health of Il2(-/-)Il21r(-/-) mice was reflected in reduced pancreatitis and hemolytic anemia and this was associated with distinct changes in lymphocyte effector populations, including the reduced expansion of both T follicular helper cells and Th17 cells and a compensatory increase in IL-22 in the absence of IL-21R. IL-21/IL-21R interactions were also important for the expansion of effector and memory CD8(+) T cells, which were critical for the development of pancreatitis in Il2(-/-) mice.

The protein encoded by this gene is a cytokine receptor for interleukin 21 (IL21). IL21R has been shown to form a heterodimeric receptor complex with the common gamma-chain, a receptor subunit also shared by the receptors for interleukin 2, 4, 7, 9, and 15. This receptor transduces the growth promoting signal of IL21 with pleiotropic effects on many immune cell types, including promoting CD8+ T cell activation and proliferation, NK cell maturation and cytotoxicity, differentiation of CD4+ T cells, including regulatory T cells, in addition to B cells proliferation, memory B cell formation, isotype switching, and differentiation to plasma cells (PMID: 33929673). \n \nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by both genetic and experimental evidence. At least eight variants (missense, splice site, deletion, nonsense and frameshift) have been reported in thirteen probands (PMIDs: 23440042, 25769540, 17234735, and 33929673). The main clinical manifestations were recurrent bacterial, fungal, and viral infections; cryptosporidiosis-associated cholangitis; and asthma (PMID: 33929673). The reported biallelic IL21R variants has been shown to result in functional defects in  T cells and impaired generation of memory B cells and induction of class switching (PMID: 33929673). A major role of IL21R in immune system regulation has been demonstrated by the sustained Treg defect detected in  Il2−/−Il21r−/− double knockout mice (PMID: 24446516).\n \nIn summary, *IL21R* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive immunodeficiency, 56. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4dbeac16-997c-43c0-9fb6-eaa98d0816f9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
