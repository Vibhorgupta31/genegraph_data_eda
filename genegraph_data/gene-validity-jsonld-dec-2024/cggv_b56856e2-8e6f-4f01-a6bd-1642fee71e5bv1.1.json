By whole-exome sequencing and subsequent mutation screening, we identified de novo heterozygous mutations in GNAO1, which encodes a Gαo subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, in four individuals with epileptic encephalopathy. Two of the affected individuals also showed involuntary movements. Somatic mosaicism (approximately 35% to 50% of cells, distributed across multiple cell types, harbored the mutation) was shown in one individual. By mapping the mutation onto three-dimensional models of the Gα subunit in three different complexed states, we found that the three mutants (c.521A>G [p.Asp174Gly], c.836T>A [p.Ile279Asn], and c.572_592del [p.Thr191_Phe197del]) are predicted to destabilize the Gα subunit fold. A fourth mutant (c.607G>A), in which the Gly203 residue located within the highly conserved switch II region is substituted to Arg, is predicted to impair GTP binding and/or activation of downstream effectors, although the p.Gly203Arg substitution might not interfere with Gα binding to G-protein-coupled receptors. Transient-expression experiments suggested that localization to the plasma membrane was variably impaired in the three putatively destabilized mutants. Electrophysiological analysis showed that Gαo-mediated inhibition of calcium currents by norepinephrine tended to be lower in three of the four Gαo mutants. These data suggest that aberrant Gαo signaling can cause multiple neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including epileptic encephalopathy and involuntary movements.

Next-generation sequencing has highlighted the crucial contribution of de novo mutations to the genetic architecture of EEs as well as to their underlying genetic heterogeneity. Our previous whole-exome sequencing study of 264 parent-child trios revealed more than 290 candidate genes in which only a single individual had a de novo variant. We sought to identify additional pathogenic variants in a subset (n = 27) of these genes via targeted sequencing in an unsolved cohort of 531 individuals with a diverse range of EEs. We report 17 individuals with pathogenic variants in seven of the 27 genes, defining a genetic etiology in 3.2% of this unsolved cohort. Our results provide definitive evidence that de novo mutations in SLC1A2 and CACNA1A cause specific EEs and expand the compendium of clinically relevant genotypes for GABRB3. We also identified EEs caused by genetic variants in ALG13, DNM1, and GNAO1 and report a mutation in IQSEC2. Notably, recurrent mutations accounted for 7/17 of the pathogenic variants identified. As a result of high-depth coverage, parental mosaicism was identified in two out of 14 cases tested with mutant allelic fractions of 5%-6% in the unaffected parents, carrying significant reproductive counseling implications. These results confirm that dysregulation in diverse cellular neuronal pathways causes EEs, and they will inform the diagnosis and management of individuals with these devastating disorders.","dc:creator":"Epi4K Consortium","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"De Novo Mutations in SLC1A2 and CACNA1A Are Important Causes of Epileptic Encephalopathies."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27476654","rdfs:label":"1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:73d07e87-8de4-4808-8398-fff53090a546_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a3b7ae4f-bef1-4955-97ba-d5cf0683b0b0","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:73d07e87-8de4-4808-8398-fff53090a546_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:ce638d4e-7b4a-4eec-b5f0-726a3c7d762c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020988.3(GNAO1):c.808A>C (p.Asn270His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA395954774"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25262651","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Emerging evidence indicates that epileptic encephalopathies are genetically highly heterogeneous, underscoring the need for large cohorts of well-characterized individuals to further define the genetic landscape. Through a collaboration between two consortia (EuroEPINOMICS and Epi4K/EPGP), we analyzed exome-sequencing data of 356 trios with the \"classical\" epileptic encephalopathies, infantile spasms and Lennox Gastaut syndrome, including 264 trios previously analyzed by the Epi4K/EPGP consortium. In this expanded cohort, we find 429 de novo mutations, including de novo mutations in DNM1 in five individuals and de novo mutations in GABBR2, FASN, and RYR3 in two individuals each. Unlike previous studies, this cohort is sufficiently large to show a significant excess of de novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathy probands compared to the general population using a likelihood analysis (p = 8.2 × 10(-4)), supporting a prominent role for de novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathies. We bring statistical evidence that mutations in DNM1 cause epileptic encephalopathy, find suggestive evidence for a role of three additional genes, and show that at least 12% of analyzed individuals have an identifiable causal de novo mutation. Strikingly, 75% of mutations in these probands are predicted to disrupt a protein involved in regulating synaptic transmission, and there is a significant enrichment of de novo mutations in genes in this pathway in the entire cohort as well. These findings emphasize an important role for synaptic dysregulation in epileptic encephalopathies, above and beyond that caused by ion channel dysfunction.","dc:creator":"EuroEPINOMICS-RES

transmit signals from cell surface receptors to cellular effector enzymes and ion channels. The G alpha(o) protein is the most abundant G alpha subtype in the nervous system, but it is also found in the heart. Its function is not completely known, although it is required for regulation of N-type Ca2+ channels in GH3 cells and also interacts with GAP43, a major protein in growth cones, suggesting a role in neuronal pathfinding. To analyze the function of G alpha(o), we have generated mice lacking both isoforms of G alpha(o) by homologous recombination. Surprisingly, the nervous system is grossly intact, despite the fact that G alpha(o) makes up 0.2-0.5% of brain particulate protein and 10% of the growth cone membrane. The G alpha(o)-/- mice do suffer tremors and occasional seizures, but there is no obvious histologic abnormality in the nervous system. In contrast, G alpha(o)-/- mice have a clear and specific defect in ion channel regulation in the heart. Normal muscarinic regulation of L-type calcium channels in ventricular myocytes is absent in the mutant mice. The L-type calcium channel responds normally to isoproterenol, but there is no evident muscarinic inhibition. Muscarinic regulation of atrial K+ channels is normal, as is the electrocardiogram. The levels of other G alpha subunits (G alpha(s), G alpha(q), and G alpha(i)) are unchanged in the hearts of G alpha(o)-/- mice, but the amount of G betagamma is decreased. Whichever subunit, G alpha(o) or G betagamma, carries the signal forward, these studies show that muscarinic inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels requires coupling of the muscarinic receptor to G alpha(o). Other cardiac G alpha subunits cannot substitute.","dc:creator":"Valenzuela D","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"G alpha(o) is necessary for muscarinic regulation of Ca2+ channels in mouse heart."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This mouse model score was reduced because the phenotype occurs in a knockout mouse that is homozygous null for Gnao1, showing that this gene is involved in brain function.

In vitro, Go is also activated by growth cone-associated protein of Mr 43,000 (GAP43) and the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein, but it is not known whether this occurs in intact cells. To learn about the roles that Go may play in intact cells and whole body homeostasis, we disrupted the gene encoding the alpha subunits of Go in embryonic stem cells and derived Go-deficient mice. Mice with a disrupted alphao gene (alphao-/- mice) lived but had an average half-life of only about 7 weeks. No Goalpha was detectable in homogenates of alphao-/- mice by ADP-ribosylation with pertussis toxin. At the cellular level, inhibition of cardiac adenylyl cyclase by carbachol (50-55% at saturation) was unaffected, but inhibition of Ca2+ channel currents by opioid receptor agonist in dorsal root ganglion cells was decreased by 30%, and in 25% of the alphao-/- cells examined, the Ca2+ channel was activated at voltages that were 13.3 +/- 1.7 mV lower than in their counterparts. Loss of alphao was not accompanied by appearance of significant amounts of active free betagamma dimers (prepulse test). At the level of the living animal, Go-deficient mice are hyperalgesic (hot-plate test) and display a severe motor control impairment (falling from rotarods and 1-inch wide beams). In spite of this deficiency, alphao-/- mice are hyperactive and exhibit a turning behavior that has them running in circles for hours on end, both in cages and in open-field tests. Except for one, all alphao-/- mice turned only counterclockwise. These findings indicate that Go plays a major role in motor control, in motor behavior, and in pain perception and also predict involvement of Go in Ca2+ channel regulation by an unknown mechanism.","dc:creator":"Jiang M","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Multiple neurological abnormalities in mice deficient in the G protein Go."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model rotarod"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This is the same mouse model reported in Valenzuela et al PNAS 1997 (PMID: 9050846), so I did not score it twice.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 16 probands in 11 publications. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. Experiments performed on non-patient (HEK-293T) cells transfected with human GNAO1 cDNA demonstrated that several variants had reduced expression and loss-of-function in a cAMP inhibition assay. Notably, variant p.Gly203Arg demonstrated gain-of-function effects, but these probands have more prominent movement disorders compared to probands with other variants. The mechanism for disease may be heterozygous loss-of-function [Feng et al. PMID: 28747448], however more experimental evidence is needed to delineate contributions of loss versus gain of function mechanisms. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant rare genetic movement disorder. This has been assessed separately. In summary, GNAO1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
