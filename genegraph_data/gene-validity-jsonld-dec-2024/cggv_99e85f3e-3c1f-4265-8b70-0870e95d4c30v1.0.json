Five multi-subunit complexes in the inner membrane of the organelle are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation required for ATP production. Thirteen subunits of these complexes are encoded by the mitochondrial genome often referred to as mtDNA. For this reason, the expression of mtDNA is vital for the assembly and functioning of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Defects of the mechanisms regulating mtDNA gene expression have been associated with deficiencies in assembly of these complexes, resulting in mitochondrial diseases. Recently, numerous factors involved in these processes have been identified and characterized leading to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie mitochondrial diseases.","dc:creator":"D'Souza AR","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mitochondrial transcription and translation: overview."},"rdfs:label":"Mitochondrial translation defects"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Mitochondrial translation defects are a known cause of primary mitochondrial disease."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:99e85f3e-3c1f-4265-8b70-0870e95d4c30_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":8.45}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":6693,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":10.45,"subject":{"id":"cggv:5747758f-f2a4-4bad-9f03-c79bc1aa84ed","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:7499","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001427"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *MT-TT* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of April 17, 2023. *MT-TT* encodes the mitochondrial tRNA for threonine, which is located from m.15888-15953 on the heavy strand of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Defects of this tRNA lead to impaired mitochondrial translation, which leads to decreased synthesis of mtDNA-encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV, and V, resulting in impaired OXPHOS enzyme activities. \n\n*MT-TT* was first reported in relation to maternally-inherited primary mitochondrial disease in 1991 (PMID: 1645537), in a girl with neonatal lactic acidosis. While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-TT*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-TT* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five unique variants (m.15897G>A, m.15915G>A, m.15923A>G, m.15933G>A, m.15950G>A) in ten probands across ten publications (PMIDs: 32083134, 8769114, 9367299, 1645537, 8511015, 22638997, 29760464, 30236074, 28187756, 35808913). Age of onset in affected individuals varied from the neonatal period to more than 50 years. Clinical features in affected individuals included neonatal lactic acidosis; myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibers (MERRF); Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON); myopathy, seizures, migraines, pigmentary retinopathy, hearing loss, and diabetes. Brain imaging findings were variable. Muscle biopsies showed ragged red fibers and COX-deficient fibers. Labs showed elevated lactate. Heteroplasmy levels were highest in muscle when multiple tissues were assessed, and ranged from 33% to homoplasmy in muscle. The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function.  This gene-disease association is further supported by a known biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease (PMID: 30030363). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 17, 2023 (SOP Version 9). \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:99e85f3e-3c1f-4265-8b70-0870e95d4c30"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
