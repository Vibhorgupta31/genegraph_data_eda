Originally identified in the PKD/Mhm(cy/+) rat model of PKD, the disease is caused by a mutation (R823W) in the SAM domain of the encoded protein. Recent studies support the etiological role of the ANKS6 SAM domain in human cystic diseases, but its function in kidney remains unknown. To investigate the role of ANKS6 in cyst formation, we screened an archive of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-treated mice and derived a strain carrying a missense mutation (I747N) within the SAM domain of ANKS6. This mutation is only six amino acids away from the PKD-causing mutation (R823W) in cy/+ rats. Evidence of renal cysts in these mice confirmed the crucial role of the SAM domain of ANKS6 in kidney function. Comparative phenotype analysis in cy/+ rats and our Anks6(I747N) mice further showed that the two models display noticeably different PKD phenotypes and that there is a defective interaction between ANKS6 with ANKS3 in the rat and between ANKS6 and BICC1 (bicaudal C homolog 1) in the mouse. Thus, our data demonstrate the importance of ANKS6 for kidney structure integrity and the essential mediating role of its SAM domain in the formation of protein complexes.

Bioinformatic analysis was conducted using CLC-Genomics-Workbench™ software. Second, all exons and adjacent intronic boundaries of 129 genes (including ANKS6, in total 2216 coding exons) known or hypothesized to cause ciliopathies were targeted by a custom SeqCap EZ choice sequence capture library (NimbleGen, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) and sequenced on a Roche 454 GS FLX or an Illumina MiSeq platform (2×150 PE). 268 patients with a (poly)cystic kidney disease phenotype or an NPH-related complex ciliopathy were analyzed with an average coverage of 60-fold (GS FLX) or 120-fold (MiSeq).

ANKS6 is a critical component of the ciliary complex required for kidney and cardiovascular development and affected patients develop progressive kidney dysfunction that may or may not be accompanied by extrarenal manifestations, including hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus, situs inversus, and periportal liver fibrosis. At least 8 variants (3 frameshift, 3 splice, 2 missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 23793029; 31678577; 31635528, 24610927, 26489029). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and protein interactions (PMIDs: 26039630, 25599650, 23793029). In summary, ANKS6 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nephronophthisis (NPHP-ANKS6). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 08/25/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:62df8a40-0b65-46a4-89c8-51f26424c523"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
