Human deafness has not previously been linked to defects in LTCCs. We used positional cloning to identify a mutation in CACNA1D, which encodes the pore-forming α1 subunit of Ca(v)1.3 LTCCs, in two consanguineous families with deafness. All deaf subjects showed pronounced SAN dysfunction at rest. The insertion of a glycine residue in a highly conserved, alternatively spliced region near the channel pore resulted in nonconducting calcium channels that had abnormal voltage-dependent gating.

We used gene-targeting technology to generate alpha1D Ca2+ channel-deficient mice to determine the physiological role of these Ca2+ channels in hearing and balance. Analyses of auditory-evoked brainstem recordings confirmed that alpha1D-/- mice were deaf and revealed that heterozygous (alpha1D+/-) mice have increased hearing thresholds. However, hearing deficits in alpha1D+/- mice were manifested mainly by the increase in threshold of low-frequency sounds. In contrast to impaired hearing, alpha1D-/- mice have balance performances equivalent to their wild-type littermates. Light and electron microscope analyses of the inner ear revealed outer hair cell loss at the apical cochlea, but no apparent abnormality at the basal cochlea and the vestibule. We determined the mechanisms underlying the auditory function defects and the normal vestibular functions by examining the Ba2+ currents in cochlear inner and outer hair cells versus utricular hair cells in alpha1D+/- mice. Whereas the whole-cell Ba2+ currents in inner hair cells consist mainly of the nimodipine-sensitive current (approximately 85%), the utricular hair cells express only approximately 50% of this channel subtype. Thus, differential expression of alpha1D channels in the cochlear and utricular hair cells confers the phenotype of the alpha1D null mutant mice. Because vestibular and cochlear hair cells share common features and null deletion of several genes have yielded both deafness and imbalance in mice, alpha1D null mutant mice may serve as a model to disentangle vestibular from auditory-specific functions.","dc:creator":"Dou H","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Null mutation of alpha1D Ca2+ channel gene results in deafness but no vestibular defect in mice."},"rdfs:label":"Dou Functional Alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:8249f2c1-ff59-4ea2-8e7e-11256c73433e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f25739b9-6a42-4397-8575-dc608a928674","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7334cb6f-158a-4386-a186-14fe4a9f782e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"ABR thresholds for pure tone, click, and noise burst stimuli were similar for control and mouse model, demonstrating normal function of IHCs.

Genetic mutations contribute significantly to this disorder. Mostly, only malfunction of the ear is considered. Here, we assessed the role of the peripheral deafness gene Cacna1d, encoding the L-type channel Ca(v)1.3, in downstream processing of acoustic information. To this end, we generated a mouse conditional Cacna1d-eGFP(flex) allele. Upon pairing with Egr2::Cre mice, Ca(v)1.3 was ablated in the auditory brainstem, leaving the inner ear intact. Structural assessment of the superior olivary complex (SOC), an essential auditory brainstem center, revealed a dramatic volume reduction (43-47%) of major nuclei in young adult Egr2::Cre;Cacna1d-eGFP(flex) mice. This volume decline was mainly caused by a reduced cell number (decline by 46-56%). Abnormal formation of the lateral superior olive was already present at P4, demonstrating an essential perinatal role of Ca(v)1.3 in the SOC. Measurements of auditory brainstem responses demonstrated a decreased amplitude in the auditory nerve between 50 and 75 dB stimulation in Egr2::Cre;Cacna1d-eGFP(flex) knockout mice and increased amplitudes in central auditory processing centers. Immunohistochemical studies linked the amplitude changes in the central auditory system to reduced expression of K(v)1.2. No changes were observed for K(v)1.1, KCC2, a determinant of inhibitory neurotransmission, and choline acetyltransferase, a marker of efferent olivocochlear neurons. Together, these analyses identify a crucial retrocochlear role of Ca(v)1.3 and demonstrate that mutations in deafness genes can affect sensory cells and neurons alike. As a corollary, hearing aids have to address central auditory processing deficits as well.","dc:creator":"Satheesh SV","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Retrocochlear function of the peripheral deafness gene Cacna1d."},"rdfs:label":"Satheesh Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:f1c0391f-e04c-49f2-9a14-e7b7df2f162a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b116abf0-d384-4ab7-970e-3563c2bf7212","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Null mice showed no motor response to auditory stimuli, suggestive of hearing impairment.

In Palestinian families with no prior history of hearing loss, we estimate that 56% of hearing loss is genetic and 44% is not genetic. For the great majority (87%) of families with inherited hearing loss, panel-based genomic DNA sequencing, followed by segregation analysis of large kindreds and transcriptional analysis of participant RNA, enabled identification of the causal genes and mutations, including at distant noncoding sites. Genetic heterogeneity of hearing loss was striking with respect to both genes and alleles: The 337 solved families harbored 143 different mutations in 48 different genes. For one in four solved families, a transcription-altering mutation was the responsible allele. Many of these mutations were cryptic, either exonic alterations of splice enhancers or silencers or deeply intronic events. Experimentally calibrated in silico analysis of transcriptional effects yielded inferences of high confidence for effects on splicing even of mutations in genes not expressed in accessible tissue.

*CACNA1D* gene was first associated with autosomal recessive sinoatrial node dysfunction and deafness in humans as early as 2011 (Baig et al., 2011, PMID: 21131953). Two unique founder variants (an in-frame indel and a missense) has been reported as homozygous occurrences in 9 individuals from consanguineous families across 3 publications (PMID: 21131953, 30498240, 32747562). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 9 additional family members. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression data, functional alteration studies, and mouse models (PMID: 21131953, 15357422, 10929716, 22678062). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on 5/1/2018. It was re-evaluated on 4/17/2024. Although new genetic evidence was included in the curation, the classification did not change (PMID: 30498240, 32747562). This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on the meeting date 4/17/2024 (SOP Version 10)","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8249f2c1-ff59-4ea2-8e7e-11256c73433e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
