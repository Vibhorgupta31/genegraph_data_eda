Cytoplasmic carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, however, is part of a tri-functional enzyme encoded by CAD; no human disease has been attributed to this gene. The tri-functional enzyme contains carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2 (CPS2), aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) and dihydroorotase (DHOase) activities, which comprise the first three of six reactions required for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Here we characterize an individual who is compound heterozygous for mutations in different domains of CAD. One mutation, c.1843-1G>A, results in an in-frame deletion of exon 13. The other, c.6071G>A, causes a missense mutation (p.Arg2024Gln) in a highly conserved residue that is essential for carbamoyl-phosphate binding. Metabolic flux studies showed impaired aspartate incorporation into RNA and DNA through the de novo synthesis pathway. In addition, CTP, UTP and nearly all UDP-activated sugars that serve as donors for glycosylation were decreased. Uridine supplementation rescued these abnormalities, suggesting a potential therapy for this new glycosylation disorder.","dc:creator":"Ng BG","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Biallelic mutations in CAD, impair de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and decrease glycosylation precursors."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e4a828c0-e00b-4756-aec7-b83e529ec8e4_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e4a828c0-e00b-4756-aec7-b83e529ec8e4_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4ad93d85-855a-4289-9c6d-e5f60721efe2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7930b23d-1a58-492d-b363-00df5f23c902","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"The CAD gene encodes a trifunctional protein which is associated with the enzymatic activity of the first 3 enzymes in the 6-step pathway of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis.

Progress in defining the molecular bases does not often translate into effective treatment. Notable exceptions include certain inborn errors of metabolism amenable to dietary intervention. CAD encodes a multifunctional enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Alternatively, pyrimidines can be recycled from uridine. Exome sequencing in three families identified biallelic CAD mutations in four children with global developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, and anaemia with anisopoikilocytosis. Two died aged 4 and 5 years after a neurodegenerative disease course. Supplementation of the two surviving children with oral uridine led to immediate cessation of seizures in both. A 4-year-old female, previously in a minimally conscious state, began to communicate and walk with assistance after 9 weeks of treatment. A 3-year-old female likewise showed developmental progress. Blood smears normalized and anaemia resolved. We establish CAD as a gene confidently implicated in this neurometabolic disorder, characterized by co-occurrence of global developmental delay, dyserythropoietic anaemia and seizures. While the natural disease course can be lethal in early childhood, our findings support the efficacy of uridine supplementation, rendering CAD deficiency a treatable neurometabolic disorder and therefore a potential condition for future (genetic) newborn screening.","dc:creator":"Koch J","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"CAD mutations and uridine-responsive epileptic

Thirteen variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice site) that have been reported in 8 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs 25678555, 28007989, 32117025, 32820246, 29396846) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. Patients have a range of symptoms, including early-onset epilepsy, developmental delay, developmental regression, and anemia. The disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are reportedly unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of CAD, which is involved in de novo synthesis of uridine 5-monophosphate (UMP), the precursor of pyrimidine nucleotides (PMID 34288185). In vitro assays support a defect in this pathway and supplementation of uridine has been shown to improve the clinical outcome of patients with variants in CAD (PMIDs 25678555, 32461667). Studies in zebrafish and Drosophila also support a role in pyrimidine biosynthesis (PMIDs 15937129, 5004701). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between CAD and autosomal recessive developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
