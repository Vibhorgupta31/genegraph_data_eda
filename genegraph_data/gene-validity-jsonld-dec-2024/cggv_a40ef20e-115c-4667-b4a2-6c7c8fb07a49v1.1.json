Several animal models of the MEN1 syndrome have been generated in different organisms by introducing loss-of-function mutations in the orthologues of the humanMEN1gene. In this review, we will discuss MEN1 and MEN1-like models in Drosophila, mice and rats. These model systems with their specific advantages and limitations have contributed to elucidate the function of Menin in tumorigenesis, which turned out to be remarkably conserved from flies to mammals, as well as the biology of the disease. Mouse models of MEN1 closely resemble the human disease in terms of tumor spectrum and associated hormonal changes, although individual tumor frequencies are variable. Rats affected by the MENX (MEN1-like) syndrome share some features with MEN1 patients albeit they bear a germline mutation inCdkn1b(p27) and not inMen1BothMen1-knockout mice and MENX rats have been exploited for therapy-response studies testing novel drugs for efficacy against neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and have provided promising leads for novel therapies. In addition to presenting well-established models of MEN1, we also discuss potential models which, if implemented, might broaden even further our knowledge of neuroendocrine tumorigenesis. In the future, patient-derived xenografts in zebrafish or mice might allow us to expand the tool-box currently available for preclinical studies of MEN1-associated tumors.","dc:creator":"Mohr H","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Animal models of MEN1."},"rdfs:label":"Multiple mouse models of MEN1 recapitulate MEN1 syndrome"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":4,"dc:description":"Since this score is taking into consideration several mouse models of MEN1 that are all LOF variation (single exon excision to multiple exon excisions), and all mice recapitulate tumor formation due to the MEN1 genetic variation alone, I have increased the points to maximum."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:a40ef20e-115c-4667-b4a2-6c7c8fb07a49_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a40ef20e-115c-4667-b4a2-6c7c8fb07a49_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:125e5a38-aff0-4612-9767-509c5676e60f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d65806c3-e542-4a82-b662-f105678c841e","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Dideoxy fingerprinting (ddF) was used to determine alterations in the gene product.

There is abundant evidence published associating the MEN1 gene with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, since the gene-disease relationship was first proposed by Chandrasekharappa SC, et al., 1997 (PMID: 9103196). Multiple case level studies have been performed with MEN1 patients that have variants in the MEN1 gene. The variants include single amino acid changes or deletions that affect the stability of the protein and nonsense or frameshift LOF variants. A significant amount of case-level data is available; the maximum points for genetic evidence has been reached (12 points). Multiple mouse models of MEN1 have been established to show development of tumors consistent with MEN1 syndrome. In summary, MEN1 is definitively associated with the autosomal autosomal dominant Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 syndrome. This has been demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a40ef20e-115c-4667-b4a2-6c7c8fb07a49"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
