The cause of ET is unknown. Hereditary thrombocythaemia (HT) with autosomal-dominant transmission has been described with manifestations similar to those of sporadic ET. As the thrombopoietin gene (THPO) encodes a lineage-restricted growth factor with profound stimulatory effects on megakaryopoiesis and platelet production, we tested the hypothesis that HT results from a mutation in the human THPO gene. In a Dutch family with eleven affected individuals, the thrombopoietin protein (TPO) concentrations in serum were consistently elevated in individuals with HT. We derived an intragenic CA marker for the human THPO gene and performed linkage analysis in fourteen informative meioses in this family. This resulted in a lod score of 3.5 at theta=0. A G-->C transversion was found in the splice donor site of intron 3 of the THPO gene in all affected family members. This mutation leads to THPO mRNAs with shortened 5'-untranslated regions (UTR) that are more efficiently translated than the normal THPO transcripts. We conclude that a splice donor mutation in THPO leads to systemic overproduction of TPO and causes thrombocythaemia.","dc:creator":"Wiestner A","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"An activating splice donor mutation in the thrombopoietin gene causes hereditary thrombocythaemia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e99d3899-efbe-4cb9-9170-748ea92892ce_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e99d3899-efbe-4cb9-9170-748ea92892ce_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9ccebef8-3c66-4205-b31e-f6792ebb6bca","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8bcc089a-58aa-4179-b9af-a7d09b446d66","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"MPL is the receptor for TPO.

However, studies have also shown that the extracellular domain of Mpl (Mpl-EC) interacts with human (h) NUDC, a protein previously characterized as a human homolog of a fungal nuclear migration protein. This study was undertaken to further delineate the putative binding domain on the Mpl receptor. Using the yeast two-hybrid system assay and co-immunoprecipitation, we identified that within the Mpl-EC domain 1 (Mpl-EC-D1), amino acids 102-251 were strongly involved in ligand binding. We subsequently expressed five subdomains within this region with T7 phage display. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent binding assays identified a short stretch of peptide located between residues 206 and 251 as the minimum binding domain for both TPO and hNUDC. A series of sequential Ala replacement mutations in the region were subsequently used to identify the specific residues most involved in ligand binding. Our results point to two hydrophobic residues, Leu(228) and Leu(230), as having substantial effects on hNUDC binding. For TPO binding, mutations in residues Asp(235) and Leu(239) had the largest effect on binding efficacy. In addition, deletion of the conservative motif WGSWS reduced binding capacity for hNUDC but not for TPO. These separate binding sites on the Mpl receptor for TPO and hNUDC raise interesting implications for the cytokine-receptor interactions.","dc:creator":"Chen WM","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Identification of the residues in the extracellular domain of thrombopoietin receptor involved in the binding of thrombopoietin and a nuclear distribution protein (human NUDC)."},"rdfs:label":"Chen_Interaction with MPL"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:13747480-7916-4c43-88a1-adaef0db7428","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0c316d97-9d3f-4ead-9ae6-412507a5beb0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"THPO is directly involved in thrombopoiesis and gain of function variants in THPO lead to increase in platelet counts.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23594368","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Megakaryocytopoiesis involves the commitment of haematopoietic stem cells, proliferation and terminal differentiation of megakaryocytic progenitors (MK-p) and maturation of megakaryocytes (MKs) to produce functional platelets. This complex process occurs in specialized niches in the bone marrow where MKs align adjacent to vascular endothelial cells, form proplatelet projections and release platelets into the circulation. Thrombopoietin (THPO, TPO) is the primary growth factor for the MK lineage and necessary at all stages of development. THPO is constitutively produced in the liver, and binds to MPL (c-Mpl) receptor on platelets and MKs. This activates a cascade of signalling molecules, which induce transcription factors to drive MK development and thrombopoiesis. Decreased turnover rate and platelet number result in increased levels of free THPO, which induces a concentration-dependent compensatory response of marrow-MKs to enhance platelet production. Newly developed thrombopoietic agents operating via MPL receptor facilitate platelet production in thrombocytopenic states, primarily immune thrombocytopenia. Other drugs are available for attenuating malignant thrombocytosis. Herein, we review the regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production in normal and disease states, and the innovative drugs and therapeutic modalities to stimulate or decrease thrombopoiesis.","dc:creator":"Deutsch VR","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Advances in megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis: from bench to bedside."},"rdfs:label":"Deutsch_thrombopoiesis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:dcdf5576-7da2-4bf0-b725-8700ce8b3d38","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ca57f617-2ce0-4650-b390-e846157ee476","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"MPL is the receptor for thrombopoietin on the cell surface of HSCs, megakaryocytes and platelets, and along with THPO is involved in megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23594368","rdfs:label":"Deutsch_Function similar to MPL"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:e99d3899-efbe-4cb9-9170-748ea92892ce_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b76cc817-9cdf-4e15-9361-260e89e35472","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b35c1553-09b7-4022-b5b4-8c655f91859e","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"To examine the functional effects of increased thrombopoietin levels on downstream JAK-STAT signaling, phospho-specific flow cytometry was performed on peripheral blood samples from the family members.

The disease mechanism is gain of function. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes genetic evidence (case-level and family data) and experimental evidence (biochemical functions and protein interaction).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 10.35 points: Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in 12 publications (PMIDs: 9694695, 9425899, 10583217, 18367486, 22194398, 32430933, 19553636, 22453305, 32067437, 37962621, 38548144, 36811253).
