In an in vitro system, composed of [125I]fibrinogen-labeled plasma clot suspended in circulating human plasma, rt-PA and mt-PA caused a very similar dose-related degree of fibrinolysis without causing extensive fibrinolytic activation and fibrinogen breakdown in the surrounding plasma. Urokinase only induced fibrinolysis at a 5- to 10-fold higher concentration and in association with extensive fibrinogenolysis. Intravenous injection of mixtures of labeled (0.4 microCi/kg) and unlabeled (2000 I.U./kg) mt-PA or rt-PA resulted in a rapid but similar disappearance of activity from plasma (T1/2 of 3 min) and specific accumulation of tracer in the liver. In rabbits with experimental jugular vein thrombosis, rt-PA and mt-PA caused a very similar dose-dependent thrombolysis without causing substantial systemic activation of the fibrinolytic system and fibrinogenolysis. Urokinase induced significant thrombolysis only at a 10-fold higher dose and this was associated with systemic fibrinolytic activation. Infusion of 96,000 I.U./kg (approximately equal to 1 mg/kg) of mt-PA or rt-PA over 4 hr induced approximately 70% lysis, whereas a 10-fold higher dose of urokinase yielded 35 to 40% lysis. Two subfractions of rt-PA differing in the extent of glycosylation had very similar thrombolytic properties. It is concluded that the potentially more readily available rt-PA could constitute a specific, fibrin-selective thrombolytic agent.","dc:creator":"Collen D","dc:date":"1984","dc:title":"Biological properties of human tissue-type plasminogen activator obtained by expression of recombinant DNA in mammalian cells."},"rdfs:label":"fibrinolysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), obtained by expression in mammalian cells of recombinant DNA coding for the entire sequence of t-PA (rt-PA), was compared with natural activator from melanoma cell culture (mt-PA).

Increased tPA release has been reported with hyperfibrinolysis (PMID: 6401391), which manifests as excessive bleeding, while decreased release leads to hypofibrinolysis (PMID: 665314, PMID: 6890710), which can result in thrombosis or embolism. The reported hypofibrinolysis due to decreased tPA has not been confirmed to be a result of genetic variation in *PLAT* though an assertion has been made for autosomal dominant thrombophilia due to decreased release of tissue plasminogen activator. Diagnostic high-throughput sequencing of bleeding, thrombotic and platelet disorders has identified two heterozygous missense variants in patients with deep vein thrombosis (PMID: 31064749). These are rare variants of uncertain significance, which have not been functionally characterized. The biochemical function of *PLAT* in fibrinolysis (PMID: 6541693) and a homozygous null mouse model (PMID: 8133887) with increased thrombosis are consistent with the possibility of a *PLAT* related thrombophilia. Although there has been an assertion of a gene-disease relationship, the evidence is not compelling with only a few cases with non-specific phenotypes and uncharacterized missense variants. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *PLAT* and autosomal dominant thrombophilia has been disputed. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *PLAT* plays in this disease.\n\nOf note, several polymorphisms in *PLAT* have been associated with vascular t-PA release, with conflicting results, regarding their possible association with cardiovascular disease (PMIDs: 9193430, 10959683, 12891381, 12643326) however these were not considered in the curation of autosomal dominant thrombophilia. Additionally, an autosomal recessive lethal hydranencephaloly-diaphragmatic hernia syndrome has been reported in one patient with a frameshift variant in *PLAT* (PMID: 27417437), but due to differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability this is considered a separate disease entity from the autosomal dominant thrombophilia and was not considered in this curation.\nAlthough there has been an assertion of a gene-disease relationship, the evidence is not compelling with only a few cases with non-specific phenotypes and uncharacterized missense variants.
