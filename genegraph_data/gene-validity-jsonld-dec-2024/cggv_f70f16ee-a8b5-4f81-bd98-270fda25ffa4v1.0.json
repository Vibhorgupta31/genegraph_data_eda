Both yeast and human Sdh5 interact with the catalytic subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, a component of both the electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Sdh5 is required for SDH-dependent respiration and for Sdh1 flavination (incorporation of the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor).

Twenty-six Chinese patients with a diagnosis of HNPGLÔºà14 male and 12 female, respectivelyÔºâwere recruited, who were followed up from 2000 to 2012. Genomic DNA was obtained from resected tumor tissues and peripheral blood samples. Seven genes, Succinate dehydrogenase complex A,B,C,D (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD), succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 2 (SDHAF2), TMEM127 (transmembrane protein 127) and VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau), were screened by direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was performed to search for potential large deletions or duplications of SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF1 and SDHAF2. The total frequency of germline mutations was 30.8% (8/26), including 5 cases with missense mutation p.Met1Ile in SDHD, 1 case with missense mutation p.Tyr216Cys in SDHB, and 1 case with a novel truncation mutation p.Gln44Ter in SDHAF2. MLPA showed one patient with malignant HNPGL had heterozygous deletions of exon1, 2, 3, 7 and 8 in SDHB. Mutations in SDHD were the leading cause of HNPGL in this study. Mutation carriers were younger than non-mutation carriers (p¬†<¬†0.01) and more likely to suffer from multiple tumors (p¬†=¬†0.048), especially with mutations in SDHD. The presence of mutation was associated with the development of larger tumors (p¬†=¬†0.021). This study confirmed that the missense mutation p.Met1Ile at the start codon in SDHD was a hotspot in chinese patients with HNPGLs.

In comparison with paragangliomas located in the abdomen and the chest, which are generally catecholamine secreting (sPGLs) and sympathetic in origin, HNPGLs are, in fact, parasympathetic in origin and are generally nonsecreting. Overall, 79 consecutive patients with HNPGL were examined for mutations in SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2, VHL, MAX, and TMEM127 genes by PCR/sequencing. According to a detailed family history (FH) and clinical, laboratory (including metanephrines), and instrumental examinations, patients were divided into three groups: a) patients with a positive FH for HNPGL (index cases only), b) patients with a negative FH and multiple HNPGLs (synchronous or metachronous) or HNPGL associated with an sPGL, and c) patients with negative FH and single HNPGL. The ten patients in group a) proved to be SDHD mutation carriers. The 16 patients in group b) proved to be SDHD mutation carriers. Among the 53 patients in group c), ten presented with germ-line mutations (three SDHB, three SDHD, two VHL, and two SDHAF2). An sPGL was found at diagnosis or followed up in five patients (6.3%), all were SDHD mutation carriers. No SDHC, SDHA, MAX, and TMEM127 mutations were found. In SDHD mutation carriers, none of the patients affected by HNPGL associated with sPGL presented missense mutations. In conclusion, a positive FH or the presence of multiple HNPGLs is a strong predictor for germ-line mutations, which are also present in 18.8% of patients carefully classified as sporadic. The most frequently mutated gene so far is SDHD but others, including SDHB, SDHAF2, and VHL, may also be affected.","dc:creator":"Piccini V","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Head and neck paragangliomas: genetic spectrum and clinical variability in 79 consecutive patients."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22241717","rdfs:label":"Women"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Default score.

The molecular mechanism is loss of function in one of the 4 genes comprising the succinate dehydrogenase and SDHAF gene for flavination of SDHA, and stabilization of the SDH complex. This is a curation for SDHAF2 and SDHAF2 associated Hereditary Paraganglioma-Pheochromocytoma syndromes (PGL/PCC) (Paraganglioma 2, MIM: 601650). SDHAF2 was first reported in relation to PGL/PCC in 2009 [Hao et al., PMID: 19628817]. SDHAF2 related hereditary PGL/PCC syndromes are rare and only account for less than 0.1% of the cases with PGL/PCC. A Dutch founder variant in exon 2 of SDHAF2 gene, NM_017841.2(SDHAF2):c.232G>A (p.Gly78Arg), was identified in a large Dutch family via linkage study over a 30 years of period, which showed a parent-of-origin effect [PMIDs: 19628817, 6286462, 7814027, 8388849, 21224366]. Evidence suggests that this pathogenic variant in exon 2 of SDHAF2 destabilizes the protein, impairing its interaction with SDHA [PMID: 19628817]. This variant was also reported in a small Spanish family [PMID: 20071235], and sporadic cases [PMID: 28384794]. A variant at the same codon, but with different nucleotide change, NM_017841.4:c.232G>C p.Gly78Arg, was reported in a sporadic case from a cohort of 79 patients [PMID: 22241717]. Another missense variant and three nonsense variants are included in this curation [PMIDs: 26096992, 26269449, 22241717]. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Experimental evidence is mainly from a comprehensive study on the p.Gly78Arg Dutch founder variant [PMID: 19628817]. The SDHA flavination was decreased which results from impaired interaction with SDHA in patients‚Äô tumor cells. In yeast model, wt hSDHAF2 can rescue growth defects by increasing the falvination in the model with yeast sdh5 deletion, but this missense variant had no such rescuing effect. Other studies in yeast also indicated mutations in yeast sdh5 disrupt the covalent flavination of sdh1 [PMID: 23062074]. In summary, SDHAF2 gene is definitely associated with autosomal dominant HPGL/PCC syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f70f16ee-a8b5-4f81-bd98-270fda25ffa4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
