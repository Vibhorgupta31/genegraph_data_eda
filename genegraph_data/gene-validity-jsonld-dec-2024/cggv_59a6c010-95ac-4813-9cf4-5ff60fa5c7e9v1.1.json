Clinically undiagnosed neurological disorders are the most frequent basis for test referral, and currently, approximately 25% of such cases are diagnosed at the molecular level. To date, there are approximately 4,000 \"known\" disease-associated loci, and many are associated with striking dysmorphic features, making genotype-phenotype correlations relatively straightforward. A significant fraction of cases, however, lack characteristic dysmorphism or clinical pathognomonic traits and are dependent upon molecular tests for definitive diagnoses. Further, many molecular diagnoses are guided by recent gene-disease association discoveries. Hence, there is a critical interplay between clinical testing and research leading to gene-disease association discovery. Here, we describe four probands, all of whom presented with hypotonia, intellectual disability, global developmental delay, and mildly dysmorphic facial features. Three of the four also had sleep apnea. Each was a simplex case without a remarkable family history. Using WES, we identified AHDC1 de novo truncating mutations that most likely cause this genetic syndrome.

At least 35 unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, complex rearrangement, etc.) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 40 probands in 9 publications (PMIDs: 29696776, 27148574,  24791903, 30152016, 32256298, 31182893, 29230160, 33372375, 30622101). Twelve variants (nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in 14 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 27148574, 31182893, 32256298, 29230160, 24791903, 30152016) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency (PMIDs: 24791903, 27148574). In summary, AHDC1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant AHDC1-related intellectual disability-obstructive sleep apnea-mild dysmorphism syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen (Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel) Working Group on the meeting date 11/16/2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:59a6c010-95ac-4813-9cf4-5ff60fa5c7e9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
