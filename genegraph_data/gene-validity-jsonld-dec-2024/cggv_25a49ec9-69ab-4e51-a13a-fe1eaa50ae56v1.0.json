Northern blot analysis revealed COL2A1 expression in fetal membranous cochlea to be markedly greater than that in fetal skin, kidney, cartilage, eye and brain. In situ hybridization revealed COL2A1 expression in marrow cells, osteoblasts, fibroblasts and some osteocytes, in addition to chondrocytes in otic capsule. In the membranous cochlea, connective tissue elements (spiral ligament, spiral limbus and modiolar connective tissue), neuronal cells, secretory cells (stria vascularis) and organ of Corti cells (sensory hair cells) were found to express COL2A1. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess distribution of type II collagen and correlation with COL2A1 mRNA in these morphologically and functionally diverse cell populations. In otic capsule, only cartilage was found to stain positively, and in membranous cochlea, only connective tissue structures including spiral ligament, spiral limbus, tectorial and basilar membranes, modiolar and spiral lamina cartilage contained type II collagen. Nonconnective tissue cells, marrow cells and osteoblasts did not contain immunohistochemically identifiable protein. Absence of type II collagen in a subset of cochlear cells may reflect potentially either inability to detect low levels of protein in these cells or posttranscriptional regulation.","dc:creator":"Khetarpal U","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Expression and localization of COL2A1 mRNA and type II collagen in human fetal cochlea."},"rdfs:label":"Expression and localization of COL2A1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0b3994a6-6204-4681-919b-e21017b97b64","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:369fcd00-e4a0-4a1e-a8e1-9bc1f2c3feb1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"To study the factors regulating its expression we introduced a cosmid containing the human type II collagen gene into embryonic stem cells in vitro.

The condition is characterized by \"disproportionate dwarfism, cleft palate, myopia, progressive conductive hearing loss, arthropathy, and scoliosis. Radiographs of patients with Kniest dysplasia exhibit progressive skeletal changes, including splayed epiphyses and metaphyses, platyspondyly, and narrowed joint space\" (PMID: 7977371). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case level and experimental evidence. At least 11 unique variants have been described across numerous publications. Notably, the c.905C>T (p.Ala302Val), a cryptic splice donor site resulting in an in-frame loss of 7 residues, has been identified repeatedly in patients with Kniest dysplasia (PMIDs: 7977371, 25592122, 17347327, 25525159, 8893763). COL2A1 has been definitively associated with Achondrogenesis type 2-hypochondrogenesis, Platyspondylic dysplasia, Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Stanescu type, Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita and Spondylometaphseal dysplasia with marked metaphyseal changes after curation by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP. This gene has also been associated with Spondyloperipheral dysplasia, SED with metatarsal shortening (Czech dysplasia), Stickler syndrome type I, and Dysplasia of the proximal femoral epiphyses, which will be assessed separately (PMID: 31633310).  In summary, COL2A1 is definitively associated with Kniest dysplasia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on 9/1/21 (SOP version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:25a49ec9-69ab-4e51-a13a-fe1eaa50ae56"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
