The insertion/deletion was detected only in Caucasian patients in 11 of 34 mutant alleles; the C-->T transition was found only in Japanese patients in 4 of 12 mutant alleles. Following digestion of genomic DNA by Msp I, both of these mutations were detected on Southern blots by the presence of a 2.7-kbp band; they can be distinguished from one another by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization following PCR amplification.

We have detected an unusual insertion/deletion in the DNA of patients from the pccBC and pccC subgroups that replaces 14 nucleotides in the coding sequence of the beta subunit with 12 nucleotides unrelated to this region of the gene. This results in elimination of an Msp I restriction site, a 2-base-pair (bp) deletion, a frameshift, and a stop codon in the new frame approximately 100 amino acid residues proximal to the normal carboxyl terminus. Among 14 unrelated Caucasian patients in the pccBC complementation group, this unique mutation was found in 8 of 28 mutant alleles examined. Mutant allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to amplified genomic DNAs revealed that the inserted 12 nucleotides do not originate in an approximately 1000-bp region around the mutation. In the course of our investigation, we identified another mutation in the same exon: a 3-bp in-frame deletion that eliminates one of two isoleucine codons immediately preceding the Msp I site.

Seven mutant strains were fused in all pairwise combinations and examined for increased 14C-propionate incorporation in heterokaryons. Two main complementation groups were revealed.

In this study, the crystal structure of a bacterial PCC holoenzyme and  cryo-electron microscopy of human PCC revealed that the alpha subunits are arranged as monomers in the holoenzyme, decorating a central beta-6 hexamer.

Deficiencies in PCC activity in humans are linked to the disease propionic acidaemia, an autosomal recessive disorder that can be fatal in infants. The holoenzyme of PCC is an alpha(6)beta(6) dodecamer, with a molecular mass of 750 kDa. The alpha-subunit contains the biotin carboxylase (BC) and biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domains, whereas the beta-subunit supplies the carboxyltransferase (CT) activity. Here we report the crystal structure at 3.2-A resolution of a bacterial PCC alpha(6)beta(6) holoenzyme as well as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction at 15-A resolution demonstrating a similar structure for human PCC. The structure defines the overall architecture of PCC and reveals unexpectedly that the alpha-subunits are arranged as monomers in the holoenzyme, decorating a central beta(6) hexamer. A hitherto unrecognized domain in the alpha-subunit, formed by residues between the BC and BCCP domains, is crucial for interactions with the beta-subunit. We have named it the BT domain. The structure reveals for the first time the relative positions of the BC and CT active sites in the holoenzyme. They are separated by approximately 55 A, indicating that the entire BCCP domain must translocate during catalysis. The BCCP domain is located in the active site of the beta-subunit in the current structure, providing insight for its involvement in the CT reaction. The structural information establishes a molecular basis for understanding the large collection of disease-causing mutations in PCC and is relevant for the holoenzymes of other biotin-dependent carboxylases, including 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) and eukaryotic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).","dc:creator":"Huang CS","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Crystal structure of the alpha(6)beta(6) holoenzyme of propionyl-coenzyme A carboxylase."},"rdfs:label":"Crystal structure of PCC"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The interaction of the alpha and beta subunits in generating functional PCC, and the knowledge that variants in PCCA (encoding the alpha subunit) supports the association between variants in PCCB and propionic acidemia."},{"id":"cggv:2750e7cc-0051-4351-b2e8-39d8824ea757","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad2808d9-7592-47f8-8f82-3dd35e2c3404","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Since PCCB encodes the beta subunit of PCC, defects in PCCB result in deficiency of PCC activity.

These results confirm the completeness of the clone and demonstrate the capacity for beta subunits derived from the microinjected cDNA or RNA to be transported into mitochondria and assembled with endogenously derived alpha subunits to form functional PCC.","dc:creator":"Lamhonwah AM","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Correction of the metabolic defect in propionic acidemia fibroblasts by microinjection of a full-length cDNA or RNA transcript encoding the propionyl-CoA carboxylase beta subunit."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue of PCC activity with PCCB cDNA"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:e53346ed-78ac-4714-b0ba-91cd3f4cec52","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0c3b7953-a1e8-40da-90b0-e72ff6db4ae9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Skin fibroblasts from 13 PA patients, all with documented defects in the PCCB gene (see Table 1 for genotypes), and including cell lines 3152 and 13042, which are representatives of the pccB and pccC complementation groups respectively.

In general, for non-null variants e.g. missense, 3’ PTC, N-terminal variants complement C terminal variants.

To understand the molecular basis of the intragenic complementation previously reported at the PCCB locus, we now examine the complementation behaviour of four carboxy-terminal and 11 amino-terminal naturally occurring mutant alleles both using cell fusion and reconstructing the complementation event by transfecting the mutant cDNAs to generate multimeric hybrid proteins. Alleles carrying mutations p.R410W and p.W531X are able to complement with 10 out of 11 amino-terminal mutations assayed. Only the unstable p.R512C, p.L519P and p.G112D mutants fail to complement. The results analyzed in the framework of the crystal structure of the homologous 12S transcarboxylase from Propionibacterium shermanii show that all mutant alleles studied are located at beta subunits interfaces, complementing alleles at the inter-trimer interface, where the catalysis probably happens, and non-complementing alleles at the intra-trimer interface, probably disrupting the trimer formation. Our results also show a remarkable stabilization effect when p.R410W is cotransfected with p.G246V. We propose a model for intragenic complementation requiring the production of two different beta subunits carrying carboxy and amino-terminal mutations that allow regenerating functional active sites and in which a stabilization effect between subunits could be relevant to ameliorate the biochemical phenotype of each mutation separately.","dc:creator":"Rodríguez-Pombo P","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Towards a model to explain the intragenic complementation in the heteromultimeric protein propionyl-CoA carboxylase."},"rdfs:label":"PCCB intragenic complementation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":791,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"cggv:0a4c0d13-4c6c-4049-925a-6f55491643d7","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0011628","gene":"hgnc:8654","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between PCCB and propionic acidemia (autosomal recessive) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of November 28th, 2018. PCCB encodes the beta subunit of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC). PCC is composed of 6 alpha-subunit and 6 beta-subunits. The alpha subunit is encoded by PCCA. PCC, a mitochondrial biotin-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the carboxylation of propionyl-CoA, which is produced by the catabolism of cholesterol, valine, odd chain fatty acids, methionine, isoleucine and threonine, to methylmalonyl-CoA. Variants in PCCB were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1990 (Tahara et al, PMID 2154743). At least 13 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice site, and large deletion) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 14 probands in 4 publications (Tahara et al, 1990, PMID 2154743; Tahara et al, 1993, PMID 8411997; Chiu et al, 2014, PMID 24863100; Gupta et al, 2016, PMID 27227689). Many more patients have been reported in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by the biochemical function of PCCB as a subunit of PCC (see Wongkittichote et al, 2017, PMID 29033250 for review), the finding that variants in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of PCC (PCCA) cause propionic acidemia, genetic complementation studies (Gravel et al, 1997; PMID 195466; Rodríguez-Pombo et al, 2005, PMID 15949719), and rescue of PCC function in fibroblasts from patients with propionic acidemia by PCCB cDNA (Lamhonwah et al, 1994, PMID 8188292). In summary, PCCB is definitively associated with propionic acidemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1cd49a9b-08c2-49db-8e97-e334f171e34d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
