Most P450s are microsomal and require electron donation by P450 oxidoreductase (POR); by contrast, mitochondrial P450s require electron donation via ferredoxin reductase (FdxR) and ferredoxin (Fdx). POR deficiency is the most common and best-described of these new forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Severe POR deficiency is characterized by the Antley-Bixler skeletal malformation syndrome and genital ambiguity in both sexes, and hence is easily recognized, but mild forms may present only with infertility and subtle disorders of steroidogenesis. The common POR polymorphism A503V reduces catalysis by P450c17 (17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) and the principal drugmetabolizing P450 enzymes. The 17,20-lyase activity of P450c17 requires the allosteric action of cytochrome b5, which promotes interaction of P450c17 with POR, with consequent electron transfer. Rare b5 mutations are one of several causes of 17,20-lyase deficiency. In addition to their roles with steroidogenic mitochondrial P450s, Fdx and FdxR participate in the synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters used by many enzymes. Disruptions in the assembly of Fe-S clusters is associated with Friedreich ataxia and Parkinson disease. Recent work has identified mutations in FdxR in patients with neuropathic hearing loss and visual impairment, somewhat resembling the global neurologic disorders seen with mitochondrial diseases. Impaired steroidogenesis is to be expected in such individuals, but this has not yet been studied.","dc:creator":"Miller WL","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Steroidogenic electron-transfer factors and their diseases."},"rdfs:label":"CYB5A Function - Steroid Synthesis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:eda0f7c7-9bf0-4742-8fc6-a285a6ba914d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a3507df0-1060-41a7-84d9-20d6f84901e8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Cytochrome b5 is a known cofactor for cytochrome b5 reductase 3.

Maximal 17,20-lyase activity in vitro requires the presence of cytochrome b5 (b5), and rare cases of b5 deficiency in human beings causes isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency. To study the consequences of conditional b5 removal from testicular Leydig cells in an animal model, we generated Cyb5(flox/flox):Sf1-Cre (LeyKO) mice. The LeyKO male mice had normal body weights, testis and sex organ weights, and fertility compared with littermates. Basal serum and urine steroid profiles of LeyKO males were not significantly different than littermates. In contrast, marked 17-hydroxyprogesterone accumulation (100-fold basal) and reduced testosterone synthesis (27% of littermates) were observed after human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation in LeyKO animals. Testis homogenates from LeyKO mice showed reduced 17,20-lyase activity and a 3-fold increased 17-hydroxylase to 17,20-lyase activity ratio, which were restored to normal upon addition of recombinant b5. We conclude that Leydig cell b5 is required for maximal androgen synthesis and to prevent 17-hydroxyprogesterone accumulation in the mouse testis; however, the b5-independent 17,20-lyase activity of mouse steroid 17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase is sufficient for normal male genital development and fertility.

In contrast to the liver-specific deletion, complete deletion of cytochrome b(5) leads to a neonatal increase in the expression of many hepatic P450s at both the protein and mRNA level. In extrahepatic tissues, some changes in P450 expression were also observed that were isoform-dependent. In vitro cytochrome P450 activities in liver, kidney, lung, and small intestine of BCN mice were determined for a range of model substrates and probe drugs; a profound reduction in the metabolism of some substrates, particularly in lung, kidney, and small intestine, was observed. In vivo, the metabolism of metoprolol was significantly altered in BCN mice, in contrast to the previous finding in the liver-specific cytochrome b(5) deletion, suggesting that extrahepatic cytochrome b(5) plays a significant role in its disposition. Testicular Cyp17 hydroxylase and lyase activities were also significantly reduced by cytochrome b(5) deletion, leading to significantly lower levels of testicular testosterone.

Methemoglobinemia 4, also referred to as methemoglobinemia and ambiguous genitalia (MIM#250790) or pure isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency, is characterized by mildly elevated serum methemoglobin, cyanosis, and 46,XY disorder of sexual differentiation (DSD). The cytochrome b5 protein encoded by *CYB5A* interacts with cytochrome P450 17A1 and stimulates 17,20-lyase activity, which is required for the synthesis of androgen hormones. Biallelic loss of *CYB5A* expression or disruption of this interaction leads to 46,XY DSD. To date, only one 46,XX proband with biallelic variants in *CYB5A* has been reported. This individual showed no evidence of DSD or other symptoms beyond elevated serum methemoglobin and cyanosis (PMID: 32051920). \n\nSix variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, canonical splice acceptor site) that have been reported in five probands in five publications (PMIDs: 8168836, 20080843, 22170710, 32051920, 33626548) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, expression studies, *in vitro* functional assays of wild-type function, and demonstrated protein-protein interactions with P450 17A1 (PMIDs: 20430864, 25613900, 26974035, 33753170, 34610701, 36441026). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CYB5A* and autosomal recessive methemoglobinemia 4. This association been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
