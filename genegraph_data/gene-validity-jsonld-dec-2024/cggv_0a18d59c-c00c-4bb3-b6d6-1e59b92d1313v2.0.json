It had been shown that these families did not have mutations in the WFS1 gene (WFS1) but were mapped to the WFS2 locus at 4q22-25. A G-->C transversion at nucleotide 109 predicts an amino acid change from glutamic acid to glutamine (E37Q). Although the amino acid is conserved and the mutation is nonsynonymous, the pathogenesis for the disorder is because the mutation also causes aberrant splicing. The mutation was found to disrupt messenger RNA splicing by eliminating exon 2, and it results in the introduction of a premature stop codon. Mutations in WFS1 have also been found to cause low-frequency nonsyndromic hearing loss, progressive hearing loss, and isolated optic atrophy associated with hearing loss. Screening of 377 probands with hearing loss did not identify mutations in the WFS2 gene. The WFS1-encoded protein, Wolframin, is known to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a role in calcium homeostasis. The ZCD2-encoded protein, ERIS (endoplasmic reticulum intermembrane small protein), is also shown to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum but does not interact directly with Wolframin. Lymphoblastoid cells from affected individuals show a significantly greater rise in intracellular calcium when stimulated with thapsigargin, compared with controls, although no difference was observed in resting concentrations of intracellular calcium.","dc:creator":"Amr S","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"A homozygous mutation in a novel zinc-finger protein, ERIS, is responsible for Wolfram syndrome

The majority of patients harbour pathogenic WFS1 mutations, but recessive mutations in a second gene, CISD2, have been described in a small number of families with Wolfram syndrome type 2 (WFS2). The defining diagnostic criteria for WFS2 also consist of optic atrophy and diabetes mellitus, but unlike WFS1, this phenotypic subgroup has been associated with peptic ulcer disease and an increased bleeding tendency. Here, we report on a novel homozygous CISD2 mutation (c.215A > G; p.Asn72Ser) in a Moroccan patient with an overlapping phenotype suggesting that Wolfram syndrome type 1 and type 2 form a continuous clinical spectrum with genetic heterogeneity. The present study provides strong evidence that this particular CISD2 mutation disturbs cellular Ca2+ homeostasis with enhanced Ca2+ flux from the ER to mitochondria and cytosolic Ca2+ abnormalities in patient-derived fibroblasts. This Ca2+ dysregulation was associated with increased ER-mitochondria contact, a swollen ER lumen and a hyperfused mitochondrial network in the absence of overt ER stress. Although there was no marked alteration in mitochondrial bioenergetics under basal conditions, culture of patient-derived fibroblasts in glucose-free galactose medium revealed a respiratory chain defect in complexes I and II, and a trend towards decreased ATP levels. Our results provide important novel insight into the potential disease mechanisms underlying the neurodegenerative consequences of CISD2 mutations and the subsequent development of multisystemic disease.","dc:creator":"Rouzier C","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"A novel CISD2 mutation associated with a classical Wolfram syndrome phenotype alters Ca2+ homeostasis and ER-mitochondria interactions."}},"rdfs:label":"Rouzier Proband"},{"id":"cggv:d1aa4083-99bd-4451-8e47-c45834f73765","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d1aa4083-99bd-4451-8e47-c45834f73765_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Score downgrade of 0.1 for homozygosity accounted in the Pourreza et al. proband due to limitations in the GCI"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0a18d59c-c00c-4bb3-b6d6-1e59b92d1313_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:0a18d59c-c00c-4bb3-b6d6-1e59b92d1313_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":7.7},{"id":"cggv:25aed804-9b86-46d0-8555-980ca0e33e43_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:25aed804-9b86-46d0-8555-980ca0e33e43","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":14,"allele":{"id":"cggv:444a8fda-9c5a-42e6-844f-859b92294ae5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000181.4(GUSB):c.1856C>T (p.Ala619Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA339838"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Genotyping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000648","obo:HP_0005101","obo:HP_0000407","obo:HP_0004398","obo:HP_0000819"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:0980e690-0a84-4128-a461-acc62974e39b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:444a8fda-9c5a-42e6-844f-859b92294ae5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17846994"},"rdfs:label":"WS-3 II:10"},{"id":"cggv:0980e690-0a84-4128-a461-acc62974e39b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0980e690-0a84-4128-a461-acc62974e39b_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:0980e690-0a84-4128-a461-acc62974e39b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"When stimulated by TG, a known stimulator of ER Ca2+ release, there was significantly more intracellular Ca2+ release in the affected cell line than in the unaffected cell line"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Recurrent variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":9.7},{"id":"cggv:0a18d59c-c00c-4bb3-b6d6-1e59b92d1313_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0a18d59c-c00c-4bb3-b6d6-1e59b92d1313_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d63cc6d0-2550-4855-8ea5-fb060d7ae221","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e12af98e-a02d-4119-bd20-d9fd526113f4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"RT-PCR on cDNA derived from lymphoblastoid RNA from an affected individual and two controls showed a 336-bp product in the affected individual and a 551-bp product of expected size in controls.

The identified pathogenic variants included missense changes, frameshift deletions and insertions in WFS1 and an exonic deletion in CISD2 which all altered the respective encoded protein in a manner that did not correlate to the phenome previously described. These observations suggest the lack of genotype-phenotype correlation in this complex syndrome and the need to explore other molecular genetic mechanisms.

Cisd2 deficiency in mice causes mitochondrial breakdown and dysfunction accompanied by autophagic cell death, and these events precede the two earliest manifestations of nerve and muscle degeneration; together, they lead to a panel of phenotypic features suggestive of premature aging. Our study also reveals that Cisd2 is primarily localized in the mitochondria and that mitochondrial degeneration appears to have a direct phenotypic consequence that triggers the accelerated aging process in Cisd2 knockout mice; furthermore, mitochondrial degeneration exacerbates with age, and the autophagy increases in parallel to the development of the premature aging phenotype. Additionally, our Cisd2 knockout mouse work provides strong evidence supporting an earlier clinical hypothesis that WFS is in part a mitochondria-mediated disorder; specifically, we propose that mutation of CISD2 causes the mitochondria-mediated disorder WFS2 in humans.

Investigation on the role played by Cisd2 in specific cell types may help us to resolve these underlying mechanisms. White adipose tissue (WAT) is central to the maintenance of energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis in humans. In this study, adipocyte-specific Cisd2 knockout (KO) mice showed impairment in the development of epididymal WAT (eWAT) in the cell autonomous manner. A lack of Cisd2 caused defects in the biogenesis and function of mitochondria during differentiation of adipocytes in vitro. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and secretion of adiponectin by the Cisd2 KO adipocytes were decreased. Moreover, Cisd2 deficiency increased the cytosolic level of Ca(2+) and induced Ca(2+)-calcineurin-dependent signaling that inhibited adipogenesis. Importantly, Cisd2 was found to interact with Gimap5 on the mitochondrial and ER membranes and thereby modulate mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake associated with the maintenance of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis in adipocytes. Thus, it would seem that Cisd2 plays an important role in intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, which is required for the differentiation and functioning of adipocytes as well as the regulation of glucose homeostasis in mice.
