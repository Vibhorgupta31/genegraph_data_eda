Furthermore, it remains unknown whether Casq2 regulates SR Ca2+ release directly or indirectly by buffering SR luminal Ca2+. To address both questions, we examined heterozygous (Casq2+/-) mice, which have a 25% reduction in Casq2 but no significant decrease in other SR proteins.

In whole cell-clamped transgenic myocytes, Ca2+ channel- gated Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum was strongly suppressed, the frequency of occurrence of spontaneous or Ca2+ current-triggered \"Ca2+ sparks\" was reduced, and the spark perimeter was less defined. In sharp contrast, caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients and the resultant Na+-Ca2+ exchanger currents were increased 10-fold in transgenic myocytes, directly implicating calsequestrin as the source of the contractile-dependent pool of Ca2+. Interestingly, the proteins involved in the Ca2+-release cascade (ryanodine receptor, junctin, and triadin) were downregulated, whereas Ca2+-uptake proteins (Ca2+-ATPase and phospholamban) were unchanged or slightly increased. The parallel increase in the pool of releasable Ca2+ with overexpression of calsequestrin and subsequent impairment of physiological Ca2+ release mechanism show for the first time that calsequestrin is both a storage and a regulatory protein in the cardiac muscle Ca2+-signaling cascade.

To define how CASQ2 mutations cause CPVT, we produced and studied mice carrying a human D307H missense mutation (CASQ(307/307)) or a CASQ2-null mutation (CASQ(DeltaE9/DeltaE9)). Both CASQ2 mutations caused identical consequences. Young mutant mice had structurally normal hearts but stress-induced ventricular arrhythmias; aging produced cardiac hypertrophy and reduced contractile function. Mutant myocytes had reduced CASQ2 and increased calreticulin and RyR2 (with normal phosphorylated proportions) but unchanged calstabin levels, as well as reduced total sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+), prolonged Ca(2+) release, and delayed Ca(2+) reuptake. Stress further diminished Ca(2+) transients, elevated cytosolic Ca(2+), and triggered frequent, spontaneous SR Ca(2+) release. Treatment with Mg(2+), a RyR2 inhibitor, normalized myocyte Ca(2+) cycling and decreased CPVT in mutant mice, indicating RyR2 dysfunction was critical to mutant CASQ2 pathophysiology. We conclude that CPVT-causing CASQ2 missense mutations function as null alleles. In the absence of CASQ2, calreticulin, a fetal Ca(2+)-binding protein normally downregulated at birth, remains a prominent SR component. Adaptive changes to CASQ2 deficiency (increased posttranscriptional expression of calreticulin and RyR2) maintained electrical-mechanical coupling, but increased RyR2 leakiness, a paradoxical response further exacerbated by stress. The central role of RyR2 dysfunction in CASQ2 deficiency unifies the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying CPVT due to RyR2 or CASQ2 mutations and suggests a therapeutic approach for these inherited cardiac arrhythmias.","dc:creator":"Song L","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) mutations increase expression of calreticulin and ryanodine receptors, causing catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia."},"rdfs:label":"D307H Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not counted because, although mice develop HCM, this is likely due to CPVT pathogenesis."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":5283,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":1.6,"subject":{"id":"cggv:afb2e6ca-f948-4850-be42-ed7d7d1842ed","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005045","gene":"hgnc:1513","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"2.1","dc:description":"*CASQ2* codes for calsequestrin 2, a calcium binding protein that buffers Ca2+ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and regulates RYR2 activity. *CASQ2* has been definitively associated with autosomal recessive (AR) Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and there is a moderate level of evidence for an relationship with autosomal dominant (AD) CPVT. *CASQ2* was first reported in association with AD hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in 2007 in an isolated individual from a cohort study (PMID 17655857).
