EXT is genetically heterogeneous, with three loci, currently identified on chromosomes 8q24.1, 11p13, and 19q. The EXT1 gene, located on chromosome 8q24.1, has been cloned and is encoded by a 3.4-kb cDNA. Five mutations in the EXT1 gene have been identified--four germ-line mutations, including two unrelated families with the same mutation, and one somatic mutation in a patient with chondrosarcoma. Four of the mutations identified resulted in frameshifts and premature termination codons, while the fifth mutation resulted in a substitution of leucine for arginine. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of chondrosarcomas and chondroblastomas revealed multiple LOH events at loci on chromosomes 3q, 8q, 10q, and 19q. One sporadic chondrosarcoma demonstrated LOH for EXT1 and EXT3, while a second underwent LOH for EXT2 and chromosome 10. A third chondrosarcoma underwent LOH for EXT1 and chromosome 3q. These results agree with previous findings that mutations at EXT1 and multiple genetic events that include LOH at other loci may be required for the development of chondrosarcoma.","dc:creator":"Hecht JT","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Hereditary multiple exostoses (EXT): mutational studies of familial EXT1 cases and EXT-associated malignancies."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8981950","rdfs:label":"Family 6"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Invitae curated this variant as Pathogenic on Apr 27, 2017.

HME is genetically heterogeneous, with at least three loci, on 8q24.1 (EXT1), 11p11-p13 (EXT2), and 19p (EXT3). Both the EXT1 and EXT2 genes have been cloned recently and define a new family of potential tumor suppressor genes. This is the first study in which mutation screening has been performed for both the EXT1 and EXT2 genes prior to any linkage analysis. We have screened 17 probands with the HME phenotype, for alterations in all translated exons and flanking intronic sequences, in the EXT1 and EXT2 genes, by conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis. We found the disease-causing mutation in 12 families (70%), 7 (41%) of which have EXT1 mutations and 5 (29%) EXT2 mutations. Together with the previously described 1-bp deletion in exon 6, which is present in 2 of our families, we report five new mutations in EXT1. Two are missense mutations in exon 2 (G339D and R340C), and the other three alterations (a nonsense mutation, a frameshift, and a splicing mutation) are likely to result in truncated nonfunctional proteins. Four new mutations are described in EXT2. A missense mutation (D227N) was found in 2 different families; the other three alterations (two nonsense mutations and one frameshift mutation) lead directly or indirectly to premature stop codons. The missense mutations in EXT1 and EXT2 may pinpoint crucial domains in both proteins and therefore give clues for the understanding of the pathophysiology of this skeletal disorder.","dc:creator":"Philippe C","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Mutation screening of the EXT1 and EXT2 genes in patients with hereditary multiple exostoses."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9326317","rdfs:label":"Family 21 IIP"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"A gly339-to-asp (G339D) missense mutation in exon 2 of the EXT1 gene. \nMcCormick et al.

Individuals with MHE carry heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in Ext1 or Ext2, genes which together encode an enzyme essential for heparan sulfate synthesis. Despite the identification of causative genes, the pathogenesis of MHE remains unclear, especially with regard to whether osteochondroma results from loss of heterozygosity of the Ext genes. Hampering elucidation of the pathogenic mechanism of MHE, both Ext1(+/-) and Ext2(+/-) heterozygous mutant mice, which mimic the genetic status of human MHE, are highly resistant to osteochondroma formation, especially in long bones. To address these issues, we created a mouse model in which Ext1 is stochastically inactivated in a chondrocyte-specific manner. We show that these mice develop multiple osteochondromas and characteristic bone deformities in a pattern and a frequency that are almost identical to those of human MHE, suggesting a role for Ext1 LOH in MHE. Surprisingly, however, genotyping and fate mapping analyses reveal that chondrocytes constituting osteochondromas are mixtures of mutant and wild-type cells. Moreover, osteochondromas do not possess many typical neoplastic properties. Together, our results suggest that inactivation of Ext1 in a small fraction of chondrocytes is sufficient for the development of osteochondromas and other skeletal defects associated with MHE. Because the observed osteochondromas in our mouse model do not arise from clonal growth of chondrocytes, they cannot be considered true neoplasms.","dc:creator":"Matsumoto K","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"A mouse model of chondrocyte-specific somatic mutation reveals a role for Ext1 loss of heterozygosity in multiple hereditary exostoses."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model of chondrocyte-specific EXT1 mutation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Ext1-SKO mice recapitulate many of the key features of human MHE.

HME is characterized by formation of cartilaginous outgrowths-called osteochondromas- next to the growth plates of many axial and appendicular skeletal elements. Surprisingly, it is not known whether such tumors also form in endochondral elements of the craniofacial skeleton. Here, we carried out a retrospective analysis of cervical spine MRI and CT scans from 50 consecutive HME patients that included cranial skeletal images. Interestingly, nearly half of the patients displayed moderate defects or osteochondroma-like outgrowths in the cranial base and specifically in the clivus. In good correlation, osteochondromas developed in the cranial base of mutant Ext1f/f;Col2-CreER or Ext1f/f;Aggrecan-CreER mouse models of HME along the synchondrosis growth plates. Osteochondroma formation was preceded by phenotypic alteration of cells at the chondro-perichondrial boundary and was accompanied by ectopic expression of major cartilage matrix genes -collagen 2 and collagen X- within the growing ectopic masses. Because chondrogenesis requires bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, we asked whether osteochondroma formation could be blocked by a BMP signaling antagonist. Systemic administration with LDN-193189 effectively inhibited osteochondroma growth in conditional Ext1-mutant mice. In vitro studies with mouse embryo chondrogenic cells clarified the mechanisms of LDN-193189 action that turned out to include decreases in canonical BMP signaling pSMAD1/5/8 effectors but interestingly, concurrent increases in such anti-chondrogenic mechanisms as pERK1/2 and Chordin, Fgf9 and Fgf18 expression.

Recent mouse studies have indicated that formation of stereotypic exostoses requires a complete loss of Ext expression, suggesting that a similar local loss of EXT function may underlie exostosis formation in patients. To further test this possibility and gain greater insights into pathogenic mechanisms, we created heterozygous Ext1(+/-) and compound Ext1(+/-)/Ext2(+/-) mice. Like Ext2(+/-) mice described previously (Stickens et al. Development 132:5055), Ext1(+/-) mice displayed rib-associated exostosis-like outgrowths only. However, compound heterozygous mice had nearly twice as many outgrowths and, more importantly, displayed stereotypic growth plate-like exostoses along their long bones. Ext1(+/-)Ext2(+/-) exostoses contained very low levels of immuno-detectable heparan sulfate, and Ext1(+/-)Ext2(+/-) chondrocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts in vitro produced shortened heparan sulfate chains compared to controls and responded less vigorously to exogenous factors such as FGF-18. We also found that rib outgrowths formed in Ext1(f/+)Col2Cre and Ext1(f/+)Dermo1Cre mice, suggesting that ectopic skeletal tissue can be induced by conditional Ext ablation in local chondrogenic and/or perichondrial cells. The study indicates that formation of stereotypic exostoses requires a significant, but not complete, loss of Ext expression and that exostosis incidence and phenotype are intimately sensitive to, and inversely related to, Ext expression. The data also indicate that the nature and organization of ectopic tissue may be influenced by site-specific anatomical cues and mechanisms.","dc:creator":"Zak BM","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Compound heterozygous loss of Ext1 and Ext2 is sufficient for formation of multiple exostoses in mouse ribs and long bones."},"rdfs:label":"Loss of Ext1 AND Ext2 form ME in mouse long bone"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Ext1+/− mice displayed rib-associated exostosis-like outgrowths only.
