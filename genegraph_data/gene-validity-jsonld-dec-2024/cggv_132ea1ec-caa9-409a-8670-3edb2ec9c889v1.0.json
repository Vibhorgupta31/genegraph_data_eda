We studied the LMNA gene in 67 consecutive patients with DC (18 had familial DC, 17 had possible familial DC, and 32 sporadic DC). From genomic DNA, coding regions of the LMNA gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, studied by single-strand conformation polymorphism, and cycle sequenced. Mutations were confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Two disease-causing mutations were found in families A and B. In family A, a novel R349L mutation was present in the mother and her identical twin daughters. They required cardiac transplantation at 36, 18, and 20 years of age. In family B, the R190W mutation was present in 2 cousins with DC and without conduction system disease (1 had cardiac transplantation at 45 years of age and 1 died suddenly at 46 years of age) and in 2 of their sons. The mothers of the 2 affected patients died due to cardiac causes in their 40s (1 died suddenly). One of the carriers fulfilled diagnostic criteria for isolated left ventricular noncompaction. Our data associated the R349L and R190W mutations in LMNA with severe forms of familial DC. LMNA mutations should be considered in the genetic screening of patients with familial DC without conduction system disease.

Using transfection of lamin-A/C-deficient fibroblasts, we have studied the effects of nine pathogenic mutations on the ability of lamin A to assemble normally and to localize emerin normally at the nuclear rim. Five mutations in the rod domain (L85R, N195K, E358K, M371K and R386K) affected the assembly of the lamina. With the exception of mutant L85R, all rod domain mutants induced the formation of large nucleoplasmic foci in about 10% of all nuclei. The presence of emerin in these foci suggests that the interaction of lamin A with emerin is not directly affected by the rod domain mutations. Three mutations in the tail region, R453W, W520S and R527P, might directly affect emerin binding by disrupting the structure of the putative emerin-binding site, because mutant lamin A localized normally to the nuclear rim but its ability to trap emerin was impaired. Nucleoplasmic foci rarely formed in these three cases (<2%) but, when they did so, emerin was absent, consistent with a direct effect of the mutations on emerin binding. The lipodystrophy mutation R482Q, which causes a different phenotype and is believed to act through an emerin-independent mechanism, was indistinguishable from wild-type in its localization and its ability to trap emerin at the nuclear rim. The novel hypothesis suggested by the data is that EDMD/CMD1A mutations in the tail domain of lamin A/C work by direct impairment of emerin interaction, whereas mutations in the rod region cause defective lamina assembly that might or might not impair emerin capture at the nuclear rim. Subtle effects on the function of the lamina-emerin complex in EDMD/CMD1A patients might be responsible for the skeletal and/or cardiac muscle phenotype.","dc:creator":"Holt I","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Effect of pathogenic mis-sense mutations in lamin A on its interaction with emerin in vivo."},"rdfs:label":"transfection effect study"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"While the curators wished to score this paper with a downgraded score of 0.25, this is not allowed by the interface.

Mutations in LMNA are associated with the laminopathies, congenital diseases affecting tissue regeneration and homeostasis. One of these laminopathies associated with missense mutations in LMNA is dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction system disease (DCM-CD1). To understand how the laminopathies arise from different mutations in a single gene, we derived a mouse line by homologous recombination expressing the Lmna-N195K variant of the A-type lamins with an asparagine-to-lysine substitution at amino acid 195, which causes DCM in humans. This mouse line shows characteristics consistent with DCM-CD1. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring of cardiac activity demonstrated that LmnaN195K/N195K mice die at an early age due to arrhythmia. By immunofluorescence and western analysis, the transcription factor Hf1b/Sp4 and the gap junction proteins connexin 40 and connexin 43 were misexpressed and/or mislocalized in LmnaN195K/N195K hearts. Desmin staining revealed a loss of organization at sarcomeres and intercalated disks.

Despite one normal allele, Lmna(+/-) mice had 50% of normal cardiac lamin A/C levels and developed cardiac abnormalities. Conduction system function was normal in neonatal Lmna(+/-) mice but, by 4 weeks of age, atrioventricular (AV) nodal myocytes had abnormally shaped nuclei and active apoptosis. Telemetric and in vivo electrophysiologic studies in 10-week-old Lmna(+/-) mice showed AV conduction defects and both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, analogous to those observed in humans with heterozygous LMNA mutations. Isolated myocytes from 12-month-old Lmna(+/-) mice exhibited impaired contractility. In vivo cardiac studies of aged Lmna(+/-) mice revealed DCM; in some mice this occurred without overt conduction system disease.

The LMNA gene, encoding the highly conserved lamin A and C proteins, is a highly conserved gene that undergoes alternative splicing giving rise to prelamin A and lamin C, which can be found expressed in a wide range of tissues, including heart and skeletal muscles.  Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and case-control data.  Many variants have been reported in this gene of missense and predicted null consequences in humans with isolated DCM, over more than 20 years (Fatkin et al, 1999, PMID 10580070; Jakobs et al, 2001, PMID 11561226; Hershberger et al, 2002, PMID 12486434; Hermida-Prieto et al, 2005, PMID 15219508; van Tintelen et al, 2007, PMID 18035036; Moller et al, 2009, PMID 19875404; Botto et al, 2010, PMID 20307303; and others). Further, case-control data demonstrates enrichment of both truncating and non-truncating variants in the LMNA gene in cases relative to control subjects (Mazzarotto et al, 2020, PMID 31983221). In addition, this gene-disease assertion is supported by biochemical, protein interaction, functional alteration, expression studies and animal models.  Several biochemical functional analyses have been performed showing abnormal nuclear morphology and protein localization in cell lines expressing mutated LMNA (Ostlund et al, 2001, PMID 11792809; Raharjo et al, 2001, PMID 11792810; Holt et al, 2003, PMID 12783988; Cowan et al, 2010, PMID 20160190).  Protein interaction data has also been published, particularly in relation to loss and/or relocation of emerin (Raharjo et al, 2001, PMID 11792810; Holt et al, 2003, PMID 12783988). Knock-in mouse models (Mounkes et al, 2005, PMID 15972724) and knock-out (heterozygous) mouse models (Wolf et al, 2008, PMID 18182166) have demonstrated DCM phenotypes in these non-human model systems and experimental evidence in human cell lines have further supported this assertion (Dierks et al, 2010, PMID 19375354; Liu et al, 2020, PMID 31670395). Additional evidence is available in the literature beyond what is referenced here; however, the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence has been reached. In summary, LMNA is definitively associated with autosomal dominant DCM. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.  This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on October 2, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:132ea1ec-caa9-409a-8670-3edb2ec9c889"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
