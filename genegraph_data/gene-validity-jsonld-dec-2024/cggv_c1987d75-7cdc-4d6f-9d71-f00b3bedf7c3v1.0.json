The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (expression data; PMID: 30377171, NCBI fetal expression). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
