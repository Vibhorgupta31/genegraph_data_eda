In studies designed to examine this discrepancy, we have demonstrated that a significant proportion of red cells produced in an HbCS homozygote has a much reduced red cell life span. Contrary to previous reports, we have been able to demonstrate the expected deficit in alpha-chain production in this condition and have shown that both the cessation of globin chain synthesis in vitro and the destruction of the excess beta-chains occur unusually rapidly. Comparison with various deletion forms of alpha-thalassemia suggests that, in terms of intracellular globin chain precipitates and free beta-chain pool, homozygous HbCS red cells more closely resemble those of HbH disease, with three of the four alpha-genes inactivated, than they do the more comparable alpha-thalassemia carriers with only two genes deleted.","dc:creator":"Derry S","dc:date":"1984","dc:title":"Hematologic and biosynthetic studies in homozygous hemoglobin Constant Spring."}},"rdfs:label":"Derry_1984_proband_1"},{"id":"cggv:2568edca-5955-46a0-9fa0-2774666c623f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2568edca-5955-46a0-9fa0-2774666c623f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:2568edca-5955-46a0-9fa0-2774666c623f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The variant is known to enhance the degradation of the HBA2 mRNA (PMID: 7104225) by destabilizing a specific sequence in the 3' UTR causing ribosomes to enter that region and accelerate mRNA decay (PMID: 9045690).

Data were collected on an Arndt-Wonacott camera at -2 degrees C. The structure was refined to an R factor of 0.223 by the Jack-Levitt method, starting from Baldwin's model of human carbon monoxide haemoglobin. The active sites in the alpha and beta subunit are distinct. The iron atoms are 0.16(8) A and 0.00(8) A from the mean plane of the porphyrin carbons and nitrogens (0.12(8) A and -0.11(8) A from the mean plane of the porphyrin nitrogens) in the alpha and beta subunit, respectively, in correlation with the orientation of HisF8 relative to the porphyrin nitrogens. The haem group appears to be nearly planar in the alpha subunit but ruffled in the beta subunit. The Fe-O(1)-O(2) angles are 153(7) degrees and 159(12) degrees in the alpha and beta subunit, respectively. The oxygen molecule forms a hydrogen bond to N epsilon of HisE7 in the alpha, but either none or a weak one in the beta subunit. The following bond lengths were found: Fe-N epsilon (HisF8) = 1.94(9) A (alpha) and 2.07(9) A (beta); Fe-O(1) = 1.66(8) A (alpha) and 1.87(13) A (beta); Fe-Nporph (mean = 1.99(5) A (alpha) and 1.96(6) A (beta). These dimensions agree with the values obtained in oxymyoglobin and model compounds. The C-terminal residues, ArgHC3(141 alpha) and HisHC3(146 beta), are relatively delocalized, and their positions do not enable them to form the intersubunit salt bridges in which they are involved in deoxyhaemoglobin. The penultimate tyrosine residues, TyrHC2 140 alpha and 145 beta, are relatively localized and maintain the hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygens of ValFG5 (93 alpha and 98 beta), with only minor variations compared to their geometry in deoxyhaemoglobin. TyrHC2(145 beta), however, alternates between a major and a minor site, in conjunction with CysF9(93 beta), both sharing the internal pocket between the F and H helices while in the major conformation. This suggests that the role of the penultimate tyrosines in the allosteric mechanism may differ from that previously proposed by Perutz.

When β-globin chains are absent or limiting, free α-globins precipitate and damage cell membranes, causing hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Clinical data show that severity of β-thal correlates with the number of inherited α-globin genes (HBA1 and HBA2), with α-globin gene deletions having a beneficial effect for patients. Here, we describe a novel strategy to treat β-thal based on genome editing of the α-globin locus in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Using CRISPR/Cas9, we combined 2 therapeutic approaches: (1) α-globin downregulation, by deleting the HBA2 gene to recreate an α-thalassemia trait, and (2) β-globin expression, by targeted integration of a β-globin transgene downstream the HBA2 promoter. First, we optimized the CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and corrected the pathological phenotype in a cellular model of β-thalassemia (human erythroid progenitor cell [HUDEP-2] β0). Then, we edited healthy donor HSPCs and demonstrated that they maintained long-term repopulation capacity and multipotency in xenotransplanted mice. To assess the clinical potential of this approach, we next edited β-thal HSPCs and achieved correction of α/β globin imbalance in HSPC-derived erythroblasts. As a safer option for clinical translation, we performed editing in HSPCs using Cas9 nickase showing precise editing with no InDels. Overall, we described an innovative CRISPR/Cas9 approach to improve α/β globin imbalance in thalassemic HSPCs, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies for β-thal.","dc:creator":"Pavani G","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Correction of β-thalassemia by CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the α-globin locus in human hematopoietic stem cells."},"rdfs:label":"HBA2 deletion ameliorates loss of HBB."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Down-scoring has been recommended because HBA2 has not been deleted in a wild-type context to cause an anemia phenotype (similar to the human disease state) but rather deleted in an HBB-deficient context in which HBA2 loss is actually beneficial to reduce the formation of insoluble abnormal hemoglobin tetramers.

We explored the pathobiology of HbCS red blood cells (RBCs) because the underlying cause(s) of this MCV \"normalizing\" effect of HbCS and the more severe anemia are not fully explained. HbCS containing RBCs are distinctly overhydrated relative to deletional alpha-thalassemia variants, and the derangement of volume regulation and cell hydration occurs early in erythroid maturation and is fully expressed at the reticulocyte stage. Furthermore, the membrane rigidity and membrane mechanical stability of HbCS containing RBCs is increased when compared with HbH and alpha-thalassemia-1 trait RBCs. In seeking the cause(s) underlying these cellular alterations we analyzed membranes from HbCS and deletional alpha-thalassemic variants and found that in addition to oxidized beta-globin chains, oxidized alpha cs-globin chains are also associated with the membranes and their skeletons in HbCS containing RBCs. We propose that the membrane pathology of HbCS variants is caused by combination of the deleterious effects induced by membrane-bound oxidized alpha cs- and beta-globin chains. The membrane alterations induced by alpha cs chains are more akin to those induced by beta A-globin chains than those induced by the alpha A-globin chains that accumulate in the beta-thalassemias.

These recessive disorders occur with high frequency among populations that have historically inhabited parts of the world where malaria is endemic. Early publications identified the molecular basis of alpha-thalassemia at the protein level through sequencing of the HBA2 gene product (PMID: 1062801, PMID: 1155453, PMID: 4422784), while the inherited basis was first traced to the *HBA2* locus encoding the hemoglobin alpha chain in 1977 (PMID: 909779). Patients with homozygous deletion of *HBA2* were first described in 1984 (Oppenheimer et al., PMID: 6142152), and subsequent studies reported diverse non-deletional *HBA2* variants (PMID: 6725554, PMID: 6725554). The hemoglobin alpha chain is now known to be encoded by two closely linked loci on chromosome 16, *HBA1* and *HBA2*, with alpha-thalassemia trait caused by deletion or inactivation of two of the four alleles. While many affected cases exhibit a digenic mode of inheritance, this curation of the *HBA2* gene has focused on cases with biallelic disruption of *HBA2* and absence of deleterious variants in *HBA1*. These cases generally exhibit mild to severe anemia, decreased volume of red blood cells, decreased hemoglobin content per red blood cell, reticulocytosis, the presence of abnormal hemoglobin tetramers of gamma-globin chains (Hemoglobin Barts) or beta-globin chains (Hemoglobin H), and/or the presence of erythrocyte inclusion bodies that contain denatured hemoglobin. Splenomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia, and/or history of jaundice can also be present. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, these cases have been distinguished from other *HBA2*-related disease entities by their mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive), molecular mechanism (biallelic *HBA2* loss-of-function), and clinical presentation (less severe than cases with inactivation of three or four hemoglobin alpha chains). Therefore, *HBA2* has been separately curated for unstable hemoglobin disease, methemoglobinemia, and familial erythrocytosis, each with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The *HBA1* gene has also been curated separately.\n \nEight suspected disease-causing variants have been scored as part of this curation (one complete gene deletion, two stop-loss, three missense, one canonical splice site deletion, and one disrupting the polyadenylation signal within the 3’ UTR). These have been collectively reported in ten probands in eight publications (PMID: 2079430, PMID: 2430881, PMID: 6142152, PMID: 6725554, PMID: 8555062, PMID: 15768554, PMID: 20642339, PMID: 20854116). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of *HBA2* function conferred by null and/or hypomorphic variants that reduce alpha-globin accumulation. Eight out of ten probands were homozygous for their respective variants, while two probands were compound heterozygous. Large families with co-segregation of the phenotype with the homozygous genotype have not been found for inclusion in this gene curation. Additional case-level evidence is available in the literature but has not been included in this curation as the maximum score for this category of evidence had already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that the expression pattern of *HBA2* across human tissues is highly restricted to the blood (PMID: 23715323). Biochemical studies indicate that *HBA2* encodes the alpha chain of hemoglobin, which binds and releases oxygen as part of its function central to the role of red blood cells in carrying oxygen to the tissues of the body (PMID: 11747442). HBA2 protein interacts with the beta hemoglobin chain encoded by the *HBB* gene (PMID: 6644819), which can harbor variants associated with the closely related condition beta-thalassemia. Cells from an affected patient exhibit altered function of the variant HBA2 protein as it abnormally associates with the membrane skeleton and enhances the mechanical stability and rigidity of the membrane (PMID: 9057661). Patient cells also show destabilization of beta-globin chains and the presence of globin chain precipitates (PMID: 6725554). A mouse model of heterozygous *Hba1* and *Hba2* deletion recapitulates features of the human patients such as decreased volume of red blood cells, the presence of erythrocyte inclusion bodies, and reduced ratio of alpha-globin to beta-globin synthesis (PMID: 7550311). Defects of mice with homozygous *Hba1* and *Hba2* deletion can be rescued with the addition of a human *HBA2* transgene (PMID: 7550311), confirming the relevance of the model to the human disease state.\n\nIn summary, *HBA2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of alpha-thalassemia (MONDO:0011399). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 28th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ab18a814-6fa8-4dc5-8448-9c2c196e24c7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
