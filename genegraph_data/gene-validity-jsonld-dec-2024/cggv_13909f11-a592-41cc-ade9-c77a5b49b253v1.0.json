Germline biallelic mutations in ARPC1B have been recently described in 6 patients with clinical features of combined immunodeficiency (CID), whose neutrophils and platelets but not T lymphocytes were studied. We hypothesized that ARPC1B deficiency may also lead to cytoskeleton and functional defects in T cells. We have identified biallelic mutations in ARPC1B in 6 unrelated patients with early onset disease characterized by severe infections, autoimmune manifestations, and thrombocytopenia. Immunological features included T-cell lymphopenia, low numbers of naïve T cells, and hyper-immunoglobulin E. Alteration in ARPC1B protein structure led to absent/low expression by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. This molecular defect was associated with the inability of patient-derived T cells to extend an actin-rich lamellipodia upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and to assemble an immunological synapse. ARPC1B-deficient T cells additionally displayed impaired TCR-mediated proliferation and SDF1-α-directed migration. Gene transfer of ARPC1B in patients' T cells using a lentiviral vector restored both ARPC1B expression and T-cell proliferation in vitro. In 2 of the patients, in vivo somatic reversion restored ARPC1B expression in a fraction of lymphocytes and was associated with a skewed TCR repertoire. In 1 revertant patient, memory CD8+ T cells expressing normal levels of ARPC1B displayed improved T-cell migration. Inherited ARPC1B deficiency therefore alters T-cell cytoskeletal dynamics and functions, contributing to the clinical features of CID.","dc:creator":"Brigida I","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"T-cell defects in patients with ARPC1B germline mutations account for combined immunodeficiency."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30254128","rdfs:label":"Brigida_Proband P5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The proband was homozygous for a 1-bp deletion that causes a frameshift and premature termination of translation.

WASP exerts its effects on actin dynamics through a multisubunit complex termed Arp2/3. Despite the critical role played by Arp2/3 as an effector of WASP-mediated control over actin polymerization, mutations in protein components of the Arp2/3 complex had not previously been identified as a cause of immunodeficiency. Here, we describe two brothers with hematopoietic and immunologic symptoms reminiscent of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). However, these patients lacked mutations in any of the genes previously associated with WAS. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a homozygous 2 bp deletion, n.c.G623DEL-TC (p.V208VfsX20), in Arp2/3 complex component ARPC1B that causes a frame shift resulting in premature termination. Modeling of the disease in zebrafish revealed that ARPC1B plays a critical role in supporting T cell and thrombocyte development. Moreover, the defects in development caused by ARPC1B loss could be rescued by the intact human ARPC1B ortholog, but not by the p.V208VfsX20 variant identified in the patients. Moreover, we found that the expression of ARPC1B is restricted to hematopoietic cells, potentially explaining why a mutation in ARPC1B has now been observed as a cause of WAS, whereas mutations in other, more widely expressed, components of the Arp2/3 complex have not been observed.","dc:creator":"Somech R","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Disruption of Thrombocyte and T Lymphocyte Development by a Mutation in ARPC1B."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29127144","rdfs:label":"Somech_Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The proband and his brother were homzygous for the 2-bp deletion that caused a frameshift and premature termination of translation.

Here we show in a child with microthrombocytopenia, eosinophilia and inflammatory disease, a homozygous frameshift mutation in ARPC1B (p.Val91Trpfs*30). Platelet lysates reveal no ARPC1B protein and greatly reduced Arp2/3 complex. Missense ARPC1B mutations are identified in an unrelated patient with similar symptoms and ARPC1B deficiency. ARPC1B-deficient platelets are microthrombocytes similar to those seen in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome that show aberrant spreading consistent with loss of Arp2/3 function. Knockout of ARPC1B in megakaryocytic cells results in decreased proplatelet formation, and as observed in platelets from patients, increased ARPC1A expression. Thus loss of ARPC1B produces a unique set of platelet abnormalities, and is associated with haematopoietic/immune symptoms affecting cell lineages where this isoform predominates. In agreement with recent experimental studies, our findings suggest that ARPC1 isoforms are not functionally interchangeable.","dc:creator":"Kahr WH","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Loss of the Arp2/3 complex component ARPC1B causes platelet abnormalities and predisposes to inflammatory disease."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28368018","rdfs:label":"Kahr_Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The proband was homozygous for the a 2-bp duplication that causes a frameshift and premature termination of translation in exon 4.
