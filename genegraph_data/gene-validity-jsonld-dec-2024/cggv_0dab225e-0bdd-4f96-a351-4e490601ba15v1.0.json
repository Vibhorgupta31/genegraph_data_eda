In humans, defects in these genes result in the absence of MHC II expression and thus a combined immunodeficiency. CIITA is considered to be a master MHC II regulator and is responsible for the defect in complementation group A. Eight such affected families have been reported. We investigated the molecular basis of the defect in three patients in these families, all presenting a severe immunodeficiency. CIITA transcripts were detected in all three patients but in one at an abnormally low level. Three novel heterozygous mutations of CIITA were found in patients SP and RC. One SP CIITA allele contained a nonsense mutation, G2178A, leading to a premature stop codon and the other allele in SP was found not to be expressed. In patient RC, two in-frame deletions were detected: one of the nucleotides 3003-3084 corresponding to the exon coding from Leu(964)to Asp(991), in the paternal allele, and a CATdel3193-5 of the isoleucine codon at position 1027, in the maternal allele. Transfection of a CIITA-deficient cell line with the recombinant CATdel3193-5-CIITA cDNA revealed a loss of function for this mutant and retention of the protein in the cytoplasm. No mutations were detected in the 4.5-kb cDNA from patient OK but the level of CIITA transcript was found to be profoundly decreased. However, promoters III and IV were not affected. This last case represents the first described CIITA dysfunction due to putative mutation(s) in cis regulatory sequences of CIITA.","dc:creator":"Dziembowska M","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Three novel mutations of the CIITA gene in MHC class II-deficient patients with a severe immunodeficiency."}},{"id":"cggv:552c94df-c54b-4604-9759-0dd0f5cb43be_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:cbcd5252-21d2-4014-9600-b9f482d695cf"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11862382"}],"rdfs:label":"Dziembowska RC"},{"id":"cggv:42a16195-0306-47d0-b377-edd66d32ee36","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:42a16195-0306-47d0-b377-edd66d32ee36_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:42a16195-0306-47d0-b377-edd66d32ee36_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Transfection of a CIITA-deficient cell line with the recombinant mutant cDNA revealed a loss of function for this mutant and retention of the protein in the cytoplasm."}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Variant absent from GnomAD in all populations.

Although the transactivation function of CIITA is well characterized, the signaling events that regulate CIITA expression are less understood. In this study, we report that CIITA expression in B cells depends on protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta). PKCdelta controls CIITA gene transcription mainly via modulating CREB recruitment to the CIITA promoter without affecting CIITA mRNA stability. Inhibition of PKCdelta by a pharmacological inhibitor or knocking down of endogenous PKCdelta expression by small interfering RNA reduced CREB binding to the CIITA promoter. The decrease of CIITA gene expression in the presence of the PKCdelta inhibitor was prevented by ectopically expressing a constitutively active form of CREB. In addition, histone acetylation of the CIITA promoter is regulated by PKCdelta since the PKCdelta inhibitor treatment or PKCdelta small interfering RNA resulted in decreased histone acetylation. Taken together, our study reveals that PKCdelta is an important signaling molecule necessary to maintain CIITA and MHC class II expression in B cells.","dc:creator":"Kwon MJ","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Protein kinase C delta is essential to maintain CIITA gene expression in B cells."},"rdfs:label":"Kwon CIITA expression in B cells "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:f85396f9-07e4-47e3-9965-44dcf7c33b3e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e846f73-89b3-42b3-b80f-3d195752c7e6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0208"},"dc:description":"CIITA precipitated with NFY and RFX5 in both a cell free coimmunoprecipitation experiment and an in vivo coimmunoprecipitation.

Here, we transfected DCs with the CIITA gene using a novel transfection technique. The vector system consisted of a plasmid bound to an adenovirus via poly-L-lysine, which is covalently bound to a UV-irradiated adenovirus. After transfection, expression of MHC class II on DCs increased from 27% to 75% on day 2 after transfection. Transfected DCs were co-cultured with immunologic effector cells. Cytotoxicity of effector cells against tumor cells increased after co-culture with transfected DCs to 63% compared to 15% with effector cells co-cultured with irrelevantly transfected DCs (P=.037). This effect was dependent on the timing and period of co-culture. In conclusion, transfection of DCs led to an increase in antitumoral immunostimulatory capacity of DCs.

It is due to a defect in the regulation of MHC class II genes. A novel gene was isolated by complementation cloning, using an MHC class II-negative mutant cell line. This gene (CIITA) functions as a transactivator of MHC class II gene expression and restores expression of all MHC class II isotypes in mutant cells. In addition, CIITA fully corrects the MHC class II regulatory defect of cells from patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome. In this disease we have identified a splicing mutation that results in a 24 amino acid deletion in CIITA, resulting in loss of function of the transactivator. Hence, the CIITA gene is essential for MHC class II gene expression and has been shown to be responsible for hereditary MHC class II deficiency.","dc:creator":"Steimle V","dc:date":"1993","dc:title":"Complementation cloning of an MHC class II transactivator mutated in hereditary MHC class II deficiency (or bare lymphocyte syndrome)."},"rdfs:label":"Steimle rescue in patient cells "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:5b53fd90-921a-406c-a454-ce87b7c45059","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1b9ff339-0e36-42b6-aaa8-680764f37598","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Transduction of wild-type CIITA into CIITA null genes generated by CRISPR/CAS9 restored MHC class two expression.

To understand the role of CIITA in vivo, we have used gene targeting to generate mice that lack CIITA. CIITA-deficient (-/-) mice do not express conventional MHC class II molecules on the surface of splenic B cells and dendritic cells. In addition, macrophages resident in the peritoneal cavity do not express MHC class II molecules upon IFN gamma stimulation nor do somatic tissues of mice injected with IFN gamma, in contrast with wild-type mice. The levels of Ii and H-2M gene transcripts are substantially decreased but absent in CIITA (-/-) mice. The transcription of nonconventional MHC class II genes is, however not affected by CIITA deficiency. A subset of thymic epithelial cells express MHC class II molecules. Nonetheless, very few mature CD4 T cells are present in the periphery of CIITA (-/-) mice despite MHC class II expression in the thymus. Consequently, CIITA(-/-) mice are impaired in T-dependent antigen responses and MHC class II-mediated allogeneic responses.","dc:creator":"Chang CH","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Mice lacking the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) show tissue-specific impairment of MHC class II expression."},"rdfs:label":"Knock out CIITA mice "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5335,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":17.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:1a2a2064-bebb-4c34-80e9-e84215cafa25","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0008855","gene":"hgnc:7067","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"CIITA was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II deficiency by (Steimle et al., PMID:8402893). MHC class II molecules are essential for the presentation of exogenous peptides to CD4+ helper T cells and thus in the adaptive immune response. Mutations in four trans-acting genes CIITA, RFXANK, RFX5, and RFXAP are responsible for the primary immunodeficiency. 21 total variants, including (nonsense, missense, and splice site) have been reported in 11 probands in 11 publications. Affected individuals typically present in infancy with severe, recurrent infections, failure to thrive, low levels of CD4+ T cells, and undetectable HLA-DR expression on monocytes and B cells. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence including animal models (PMID: 8624807). Mice that are homozygous with loss of function CIITA alleles (-/-) display a lack of MHC class II molecules on B cells and macrophages and low levels of peripheral CD4+ cells. They are also unable to form a proliferative T-cell response following immunization. Further experimental evidence that supports a causative role of CIITA for this disorder includes co-immunoprecipitation (PMID: 10913187), rescue of function in patient and non-patient cells (PMIDs: 8402893, 25940550), expression (PMID:16818750) and biochemical function (PMID: 11332992).\n\nIn summary, CIITA is definitively associated with autosomal recessive MHC class II deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and the clinical diagnostic setting and has been upheld over time. Heterozygous carriers of CIITA variants are not clinically reported to have the disease. Classification approved by SCID-CID GCEP on 10/20/2022 (SOP Version 9).
