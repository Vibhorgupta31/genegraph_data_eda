In humans, β-catenin mutations that cause a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders have been identified. We identified de novo β-catenin mutations in patients with intellectual disability, carefully characterized their phenotypes, and were able to define a recognizable intellectual disability syndrome. In parallel, characterization of a chemically mutagenized mouse line that displays features similar to those of human patients with β-catenin mutations enabled us to investigate the consequences of β-catenin dysfunction through development and into adulthood. The mouse mutant, designated batface (Bfc), carries a Thr653Lys substitution in the C-terminal armadillo repeat of β-catenin and displayed a reduced affinity for membrane-associated cadherins. In association with this decreased cadherin interaction, we found that the mutation results in decreased intrahemispheric connections, with deficits in dendritic branching, long-term potentiation, and cognitive function. Our study provides in vivo evidence that dominant mutations in β-catenin underlie losses in its adhesion-related functions, which leads to severe consequences, including intellectual disability, childhood hypotonia, progressive spasticity of lower limbs, and abnormal craniofacial features in adults.

Beta-catenin is a key downstream component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Somatic gain-of-function mutations have already been found in various tumor types, whereas germline loss-of-function mutations in animal models have been shown to influence neuronal development and maturation. We report on 16 additional individuals from 15 families in whom we newly identified de novo loss-of-function CTNNB1 mutations (six nonsense, five frameshift, one missense, two splice mutation, and one whole gene deletion). All patients have ID, motor delay and speech impairment (both mostly severe) and abnormal muscle tone (truncal hypotonia and distal hypertonia/spasticity). The craniofacial phenotype comprised microcephaly (typically -2 to -4 SD) in 12 of 16 and some overlapping facial features in all individuals (broad nasal tip, small alae nasi, long and/or flat philtrum, thin upper lip vermillion). With this detailed phenotypic characterization of 16 additional individuals, we expand and further establish the clinical and mutational spectrum of inactivating CTNNB1 mutations and thereby clinically delineate this new CTNNB1 haploinsufficiency syndrome.

usually de novo, germline variants in CTNNB1 have been associated with Neurodevelopmental disorder with spastic diplegia and visual defects (NEDSDV) (MIM #615075), a condition previously described as “Autosomal dominant mental retardation type 19” in resources such as OMIM. The first report of de novo truncating variants in CTNNB1, identified by exome sequencing in three unrelated patients with a common phenotype of severe intellectual disability with absent or very limited speech, microcephaly and spasticity, was published by de Ligt et al. in 2012 (PMID: 23033978). Since then, more than 40 patients have been reported in the literature with de novo variants in CTNNB1 associated with NEDSDV (PMIDs: 24668549, 25326669, 27915094, 28514307, 33116939). The majority of the variants identified are nonsense and frameshift variants, and the disease mechanism is haploinsufficiency. Given the multiple literature reports and consistent findings of de novo loss-of-function variants in CTNNB1 associated with NEDSDV, this gene reaches the maximum score for genetic evidence. Additionally, experimental evidence in vitro  and in vivo in a mouse model heterozygous for a p.Tyr653Lys substitution (PMID: 24614104)support the role of CTNNB1 in neurodevelopment. In summary, CTNNB1 is definitely associated with NEDSDV. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 02/03/2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e119aceb-a011-4811-9abd-6731c5b3d15d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
