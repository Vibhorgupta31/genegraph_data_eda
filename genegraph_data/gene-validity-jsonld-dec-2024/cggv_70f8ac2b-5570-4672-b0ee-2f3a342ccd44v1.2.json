Dominant mutations in the gene encoding TRPV4, a calcium permeable ion channel, were identified all 10 of a series of metatropic dysplasia cases, ranging in severity from mild to perinatal lethal. These data demonstrate that the lethal form of the disorder is dominantly inherited and suggest locus homogeneity in the disease. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that the mutations activate the channel, indicating that the mechanism of disease may result from increased calcium in chondrocytes. Histological studies in two cases of lethal metatropic dysplasia revealed markedly disrupted endochondral ossification, with reduced numbers of hypertrophic chondrocytes and presence of islands of cartilage within the zone of primary mineralization. These data suggest that altered chondrocyte differentiation in the growth plate leads to the clinical findings in metatropic dysplasia.","dc:creator":"Camacho N","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Dominant TRPV4 mutations in nonlethal and lethal metatropic dysplasia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20425821","rdfs:label":"Camacho et al.

SMD Kozlowski type (SMDK) is a well-defined autosomal-dominant SMD characterized by significant scoliosis and mild metaphyseal abnormalities in the pelvis. The vertebrae exhibit platyspondyly and overfaced pedicles similar to autosomal-dominant brachyolmia, which can result from heterozygosity for activating mutations in the gene encoding TRPV4, a calcium-permeable ion channel. Mutation analysis in six out of six patients with SMDK demonstrated heterozygosity for missense mutations in TRPV4, and one mutation, predicting a R594H substitution, was recurrent in four patients. Similar to autosomal-dominant brachyolmia, the mutations altered basal calcium channel activity in vitro. Metatropic dysplasia is another SMD that has been proposed to have both clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Patients with the nonlethal form of metatropic dysplasia present with a progressive scoliosis, widespread metaphyseal involvement of the appendicular skeleton, and carpal ossification delay. Because of some similar radiographic features between SMDK and metatropic dysplasia, TRPV4 was tested as a disease gene for nonlethal metatropic dysplasia. In two sporadic cases, heterozygosity for de novo missense mutations in TRPV4 was found. The findings demonstrate that mutations in TRPV4 produce a phenotypic spectrum of skeletal dysplasias from the mild autosomal-dominant brachyolmia to SMDK to autosomal-dominant metatropic dysplasia, suggesting that these disorders should be grouped into a new bone dysplasia family.","dc:creator":"Krakow D","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutations in the gene encoding the calcium-permeable ion channel TRPV4 produce spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Kozlowski type and metatropic dysplasia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19232556","rdfs:label":"Krakow et al.

While there is phenotypic overlap between the various members of each group, the two groups were considered to be totally separate with the former being strictly a structural skeletal condition and the latter group being confined to the peripheral nervous system. We report here on fetal akinesia as the presenting feature of severe metatropic dysplasia, suggesting that certain TRPV4 mutations can cause both a skeletal and a neuropathic phenotype. Three cases were detected on prenatal ultrasound because of absent movements in the second trimester. Case 4 presented with multiple joint contractures and absent limb movements at birth and was diagnosed with \"fetal akinesia syndrome\". Post-interruption and post-natal X-rays showed typical features of metatropic dysplasia in all four.

It is caused by mutations in the gene TRPV4, encoding the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4, which acts as a calcium channel. Many heterozygous single base mutations of this gene have been associated with the disorder, showing autosomal dominant inheritance. Although abnormal endochondral ossification has been observed by histological examination of bone in a patient with lethal metatropic dysplasia, the etiology of the disorder remains largely unresolved. As dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are mesenchymal stem cells that differentiate into bone lineage cells, DPSCs derived from patients with congenital skeletal dysplasia might be useful as a disease-specific cellular model for etiological investigation. The purpose of this study was to clarify the pathological association between TRPV4 mutation and chondrocyte differentiation by analyzing DPSCs from a patient with non-lethal metatropic dysplasia. We identified a novel heterozygous single base mutation, c.1855C>T in TRPV4. This was predicted to be a missense mutation, p.L619F, in putative transmembrane segment 5. The mutation was repaired by CRISPR/Cas9 system to obtain isogenic control DPSCs for further analysis. The expression of stem cell markers and fibroblast-like morphology were comparable between patient-derived mutant and control DPSCs, although expression of TRPV4 was lower in mutant DPSCs than control DPSCs. Despite the lower TRPV4 expression in mutant DPSCs, the intracellular Ca2+ level was comparable at the basal level between mutant and control DPSCs, while its level was markedly higher following stimulation with 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4αPDD), a specific agonist for TRPV4, in mutant DPSCs than in control DPSCs. In the presence of 4αPDD, we observed accelerated early chondrocyte differentiation and upregulated mRNA expression of SRY-box 9 (SOX9) in mutant DPSCs. Our findings suggested that the novel missense mutation c.1855C>T of TRPV4 was a gain-of-function mutation leading to enhanced intracellular Ca2+ level, which was associated with accelerated chondrocyte differentiation and SOX9 upregulation. Our results also suggest that patient-derived DPSCs can be a useful disease-specific cellular model for elucidating the pathological mechanism of metatropic dysplasia.","dc:creator":"Nonaka K","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Novel gain-of-function mutation of TRPV4 associated with accelerated chondrogenic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells derived from a patient with metatropic dysplasia."},"rdfs:label":"In vitro study of patient-derived dental pulp stem cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:bc26babd-9ba8-49b0-8647-5dbb1d0b663f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7caa7eeb-a01a-45d9-a3e7-5958d0e14909","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Compared to controls, primary chondrocytes from a patient with severe infantile metatropic dysplasia, carrying c.2399G>A (p.Gly800Asp), showed increased magnitudes of calcium concentration during temperature-dependent oscillations.

We analyzed the effect of a novel TRPV4 mutation c.2398G>A, p.Gly800Asp on intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+) ]i ) regulation in chondrocytes and compared this response to chondrocytes with a frequently observed mutation, c.2396C>T, p.Pro799Leu. We observed temperature-dependent [Ca(2+) ]i oscillations in both intact and MD chondrocytes however, MD mutations exhibited increased peak magnitudes of [Ca(2+) ]i during oscillations. We also found increased baseline [Ca(2+) ]i in MD primary cells, as well as increased [Ca(2+) ]i response to either hypotonic swelling or the TRVP4-specific agonist, GSK1016790A. Oscillations and stimulation responses were blocked with the TRPV4-specific antagonist, GSK205. Analysis of [Ca(2+) ]i response kinetics showed that MD chondrocytes had increased frequency of temperature-sensitive oscillations, and the magnitude and duration of [Ca(2+) ]i responses to given stimuli. Duration of the response of the p.Gly800Asp mutation to stimulation was greater than for the p.Pro799Leu mutation. These experiments show that this region of the channel is essential for proper [Ca(2+) ]i regulation.

Clinical phenotypes include short limbs, long and narrow trunk that develops into kyphoscoliosis, prominent forehead, square jaw, odontoid hypoplasia, cervical myelopathy, stenosis, sensorineural hearing loss, and respiratory compromise (PMID: 19232556). Twelve variants (11 missense, 1 in-frame indel) reported in 16 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 19232556, 21964829, 20425821, 20577006, 27530454) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is suggested to be gain of function (PMID: 31463371). This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including expression studies and in vitro functional assays  (PMIDs: 31463371, 26249260, 19790068). Of note, variants in this gene have also been shown to cause spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia Maroteaux type, spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Kozlowski type, brachyolmia, and familial digital arthropathy with brachydactyly, which comprise a spectrum of phenotypes and will be curated separately. In some cases, there is overlap between skeletal and neuromuscular phenotypes caused by variants in TRPV4 (PMID: 31191204). Patients presenting with skeletal dysplasias may benefit from neurological, respiratory, and audiological evaluations.\nIn summary, TRPV4 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant metatropic dysplasia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
