An acute form of HT1 results in death during the first months of life because of hepatic failure, whereas a chronic form leads to gradual development of liver disease often accompanied by renal dysfunction, childhood rickets, neurological crisis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Mice homozygous for certain chromosome 7 deletions of the albino Tyr; c locus that also include Fah die perinatally as a result of liver dysfunction and exhibit a complex syndrome characterized by structural abnormalities and alterations in gene expression in the liver and kidney.

The Fah(6287SB) allele is a missense mutation in exon 6, and Fah(5961SB) is a splice mutation causing loss of exon 7, a subsequent frameshift in the resulting mRNA, and a severe reduction of Fah mRNA levels. Increased levels of the diagnostic metabolite succinylacetone in the urine of the Fah(6287SB) and Fah(5961SB) mutants indicate that these mutations cause a decrease in Fah enzymatic activity. Thus, the neonatal phenotype present in both mutants is due to a deficiency in Fah caused by a point mutation, and we propose Fah(5961SB) and Fah(6287SB) as mouse models for acute and chronic forms of human HT1, respectively.","dc:creator":"Aponte JL","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Point mutations in the murine fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase gene: Animal models for the human genetic disorder hereditary tyrosinemia type 1."},"rdfs:label":"5961SB and 6287SB Mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The ENU-induced mutations 5961SB and 6287SB cause Fah deficiency that leads to neonatal and juvenile death in mice, respectively.

PMID: 1401056). At least 84 variants (including many missense, nonsense and splicing defects, as well as deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 POINTS\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 16 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 22884142, 8318997, 7550234, 7942842, 8162054). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nSummary of Experimental Evidence: 5 POINTS\nThe gene-disease association is supported by the biochemical function of FAH, which catalyzes the cleavage of fumarylacetoacetate to fumarate and acetoacetate (PMID: 7296877); its absence results in the accumulation of fumarylacetoacetate and maleylacetoacetate, which are alkylating agents presumed responsible for the liver damage observed in Tyrosinemia Type I. Expression of FAH occurs primarily in the liver (and to a lesser degree kidneys and adrenals), which is the primary organ system affected by Tyrosinemia I, and is absent or reduced in acute and chronic patients respectively (PMID: 2378356). Mouse models have been generated both by targeted disruption of FAH and ENU-induced mutation (PMIDs: 8253378, 1129059). Both of these mouse models have been rescued by a variety of methods, including adenoviral vectors to introduce the human FAH gene and CRISPR to correct the mouse gene (PMIDs: 9095403, 26829318).\n\nIn summary, FAH is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Tyrosinemia Type I.
