Laterality defects are also often associated with reduced mucociliary clearance caused by defective multiple motile cilia of the airway and are responsible for destructive airway disease. Outer dynein arms (ODAs) are essential for ciliary beat generation, and human respiratory cilia contain different ODA heavy chains (HCs): the panaxonemally distributed γ-HC DNAH5, proximally located β-HC DNAH11 (defining ODA type 1), and the distally localized β-HC DNAH9 (defining ODA type 2). Here we report loss-of-function mutations in DNAH9 in five independent families causing situs abnormalities associated with subtle respiratory ciliary dysfunction. Consistent with the observed subtle respiratory phenotype, high-speed video microscopy demonstrates distally impaired ciliary bending in DNAH9 mutant respiratory cilia. DNAH9-deficient cilia also lack other ODA components such as DNAH5, DNAI1, and DNAI2 from the distal axonemal compartment, demonstrating an essential role of DNAH9 for distal axonemal assembly of ODAs type 2. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicate interaction of DNAH9 with the ODA components DNAH5 and DNAI2 as well as the ODA-docking complex component CCDC114. We further show that during ciliogenesis of respiratory cilia, first proximally located DNAH11 and then distally located DNAH9 is assembled in the axoneme.

Using next-generation sequencing, we detected mutations in the ciliary outer dynein arm (ODA) heavy chain gene DNAH9 in individuals from PCD clinics with situs inversus and in one case male infertility. DNAH9 and its partner heavy chain DNAH5 localize to type 2 ODAs of the distal cilium and in DNAH9-mutated nasal respiratory epithelial cilia we found a loss of DNAH9/DNAH5-containing type 2 ODAs that was restricted to the distal cilia region. This confers a reduced beating frequency with a subtle beating pattern defect affecting the motility of the distal cilia portion. 3D electron tomography ultrastructural studies confirmed regional loss of ODAs from the distal cilium, manifesting as either loss of whole ODA or partial loss of ODA volume. Paramecium DNAH9 knockdown confirms an evolutionarily conserved function for DNAH9 in cilia motility and ODA stability. We find that DNAH9 is widely expressed in the airways, despite DNAH9 mutations appearing to confer symptoms restricted to the upper respiratory tract. In summary, DNAH9 mutations reduce cilia function but some respiratory mucociliary clearance potential may be retained, widening the PCD disease spectrum.","dc:creator":"Fassad MR","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mutations in Outer Dynein Arm Heavy Chain DNAH9 Cause Motile Cilia Defects and Situs Inversus."},"rdfs:label":"RNAi DNAH9 Paramecium"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Although the model demonstrates a ciliary defect, it does not account for the observed clinical signs in patients."},{"id":"cggv:a789b607-56b6-448f-850f-edc82d6175ac","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0b7f9c18-8597-4c67-8a8b-2451d1135661","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Laterality defects are observed in patients and in model.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35050399","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Defective left-right (LR) pattering results in a spectrum of laterality disorders including situs inversus totalis (SIT) and heterotaxy syndrome (Htx).

In the current study, we identified compound mutation of DNAH9 in a patient with PCD with the following clinical features: recurrent respiratory tract infections, low lung function, and ultrastructural defects of the outer dynein arms (ODAs). Bioinformatic analysis, structure simulation assay, and western blot analysis showed that the mutations affected the structure and expression of DNAH9 protein. Dnah9 knock-down (KD) mice recapitulated the patient phenotypes, including low lung function, mucin accumulation, and increased immune cell infiltration. Immunostaining, western blot, and co-immunoprecipitation analyses were performed to clarify that DNAH9 interacted with CCDC114/GAS8 and diminished their protein levels. Furthermore, we constructed an airway organoid of Dnah9 KD mice and discovered that it could mimic the key features of the PCD phenotypes. We then used organoid as a drug screening model to identify mitochondrial-targeting drugs that can partially elevate cilia beating in Dnah9 KD organoid.

Beyond the more recognized cause of bacterial and viral infections and primary immunodeficiencies, other genetic conditions such as cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) can also contribute to the disease. Currently, there is still debate on whether genome sequencing (GS) or exome sequencing reanalysis (rES) would be beneficial if the initial targeted testing results returned negative. This study aims to provide a back-to-back comparison between rES and GS to explore the best integrated approach for the functional and genetics evaluation for patients referred for assessment of bronchiectasis. In phase 1, an initial 60 patients were analyzed by exome sequencing (ES) with one additional individual recruited later as an affected sibling for ES. Functional evaluation of the nasal nitric oxide test, transmission electron microscopy, and high-speed video microscopy were also conducted when possible. In phase 2, GS was performed on 30 selected cases with trio samples available. To provide a back-to-back comparison, two teams of genome analysts were alternatively allocated to GS or rES and were blinded to each other's analysis. The time for bioinformatics, analysis, and diagnostic utility was recorded for evaluation. ES revealed five positive diagnoses (5/60, 8.3%) in phase 1, and four additional diagnoses were made by rES and GS (4/30, 13%) during phase 2. Subsequently, one additional positive diagnosis was identified in a sibling by ES and an overall diagnostic yield of 10/61 (16.4%) was reached.

It is caused by a defect in the action of the cilia lining multiple organs of the body, including the lungs, the sinuses, hepatobiliary and reproductive organs. In general, the estimated prevalence of this condition is one in 15,000-20,000 individuals. It is characterized by the triad of chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus, which occurs in 50% of the cases. It can be associated with other diseases too. Genetic studies can aid in confirming the diagnosis of this condition. A high degree of suspicion about PCD among pediatricians, neonatologists, otorhinolaryngologists, and pulmonologists is essential to make early referrals of patients before they develop irreversible lung damage. Hence, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are very important. Multicenter collaborations might improve the quality of treatment and patient outcomes.

PCD exhibiting dynein regulatory complex subunit 1 (DRC1) exon 1-4 deletion has been reported in several Japanese PCD patients; however, no large scale studies have been performed. Here, we aimed to determine the prevalence and founder effect of this variant in the Korean population. Using an in-house copy number variation tool, we screened for DRC1 exon 1-4 deletion in 20 patients with PCD and exome data of 1435 patients in the Seoul National University Hospital repository. In cases of suspected DRC1 deletion, confirmatory gap-PCR was performed. In a PCD cohort, three of 20 (15%) patients were positive for DRC1 exon 1-4 deletion (NM_145038.5(DRC1): c.1-3952_540 + 1331del27748-bp) while pathogenic variants were found in CCDC39 (N = 1), DNAAF6 (N = 1), DNAH9 (N = 1). In the 1,435-sample exome data, seven patients (0.49%) were confirmed to have DRC1 exon 1-4 deletion. A chimeric sequence including the junction was searched from the 1000 Genomes Project data repository. One Japanese patient (0.96%) was found to have the same DRC1 exon 1-4 deletion, which was absent in other populations. This study demonstrated that the DRC1 exon 1-4 deletion is a founder mutation based on haplotype analysis. In summary, the prevalence of PCD based on DRC1 exon 1-4 deletion is particularly high in Korean and Japanese populations, which is attributed to the founder effect. Genetic testing for DRC1 exon 1-4 deletion should be considered as an initial screening tool for Korean and Japanese patients with PCD.","dc:creator":"Kim MJ","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"Prevalence and founder effect of DRC1 exon 1-4 deletion in Korean patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia."}},{"id":"cggv:13a10da2-18c5-463f-89fd-cf8104de23bb_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7ef84606-5fdb-4780-829f-7a22bfcf23f3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36747106"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient#11"},{"id":"cggv:13a10da2-18c5-463f-89fd-cf8104de23bb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:13a10da2-18c5-463f-89fd-cf8104de23bb_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"No reported respiratory signs.

Laterality defects and infertility are also reported in PCD patients, due to structural similarities between tracheal cilia, nodal cilia, fallopian tube cilia and sperm flagella. Genes encoding ciliary components and ciliogenesis factors are PCD candidates. *DNAH9* encodes a constituent of the outer dynein arms (ODA) located in the distal part of airway cilia. Mutations in this gene were first described in 2018 in patients with laterality defects and mild or no respiratory signs (PMID: 30471717 and PMID: 30471718). Between 2018 and 2024, 16 different papers reported *DNAH9* variants in a total of 31 patients. A total of 50 different mutations were detected in the reported patients and consisted of 22 null mutations, 1 in-frame deletion and 27 missense variants (PMID: 30471717; 30471718; 33139725; 35202559; 32253119; 33182294; 32037394; 33452233; 33610189; 35050399; 35116053; 35770021; 36003331; 36747106; 32996775; 36712782; 39115416).\n\nThis gene curation has evaluated the gene-disease relationship between *DNAH9* and primary ciliary dyskinesia 40 (MONDO:0032664). While most of the patients with *DNAH9* defects had laterality defects and mild or no respiratory signs, the Motile Ciliopathy GCEP defines a primary ciliary dyskinesia phenotype as including a chronic wet cough alongside either chronic year-round nasal congestion from birth or early childhood, unexplained neonatal respiratory distress in a term infant, or an organ laterality defect. Patients who did not meet these phenotypic criteria had their variants downscored to zero for the purposes of this curation.\n\nLaterality defects were observed in 20/31 (65%) patients and asthenozoospermia was reported in 4 male patients. Nasal nitric oxide measurements in 13 patients with *DNAH9* mutations showed normal to high values (36-220 nL/min) (PMID: 30471717; 30471718; 33139725; 33452233; 35050399; 32996775).\nTaking all patients into account, the genetic evidence score reached a maximum of 12 points. Ciliary investigations by transmission electron microscopy showed partial absence of the outer dynein arms. Electron tomography showed more precise ciliary abnormality consisting of a reduced volume of ODA from the distal cilia (PMID: 30471717). This is consistent with immunofluorescence assays showing absence of DNAH9 and distal absence of DNAH5, DNAI1, DNAI2 and DNALI1 in respiratory cilia (PMID: 30471717; 30471718). A reduced ciliary distal bending was observed with high speed video microscopy (PMID: 30471717; 30471718).\n\nThe DNAH9 protein is a dynein axonemal heavy chain composed of 4486 amino acids. This protein is expressed in lungs and in fallopian tubes (PMID: 25613900). Immunofluorescence staining showed its expressions in respiratory cilia and its absence from sperm flagella. Patients with *DNAH9* mutations showed altered expression of the heavy chain from cilia (PMID: 30471717; 30471718). Moreover, the cilia from PCD patients with biallelic variants in *DNAAF1* or *DNAAF3* showed altered expression of DNAH9 in the distal part of the ciliar. (PMID: 22387996 and 19944400). The interaction between DNAH9 and CCDC114 (ODAD1); another protein with genetic variants associated with PCD, was demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation (PMID: 30471718). The knock-down of *DNAH9* in paramecium through RNAi leads to loss of ciliary ODA, reduced ciliary beat frequency and an abnormal motility pattern (PMID: 30471717).\nZebrafish embryos with *dnah9* knockdown using morpholino-oligos show laterality defects and hydrocephalus, but no disturbance of ciliary number or length in the retina or Kupffer’s vesicle (PMID: 35050399). Two mouse models were generated with the CRISPR/Cas9 system leading to the deletion of exons 2-4 (PMID: 35050399; 35729109). The first model showed hydrocephalus and compromised cardiac function, ultrastructural defects in outer dynein arms, limited range of ciliary bending, and insufficient effective stroke, but no laterality defects (PMID: 35050399). Mice from the second model showed absence of distal ciliary ODA and a reduced ciliary beat frequency (PMID: 35729109). Experimental evidence including expression pattern, protein interaction and non-human models; reached the maximum of 6pts.\n\nIn summary, *DNAH9* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive primary ciliary dyskinesia 40. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of conflicting evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on September 19th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7d4c2324-1f4e-48d6-b7e9-cc66f7a9dda3"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
