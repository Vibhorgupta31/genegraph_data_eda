Recombinant expression of the mutant variant in E. coli showed that the GCDH-(p.Gly185_Ser190del) protein displayed severely decreased assembly into tetramers and enzyme activity. To discover a potential dominant negative effect of the mutant protein, we engineered a prokaryotic expression system in which expression of a wild type and a mutant GCDH allele is controlled by separately inducible promoters. These cells displayed decreased levels of GCDH tetramer and enzyme activity when expressing both the wild type and the mutant GCDH variant protein compared to the situation when only the wild type allele was expressed. Further experiments suggest that the major impact of the GCDH-(p.Gly185_Ser190del) protein in heterozygous cells consists of hampering the assembly of wild type GCDH into tetramers.

Although over 200 disease mutations have been reported a clear correlation between genotype and phenotype has been difficult to establish. To contribute to a better molecular understanding of GA-I we undertook a detailed molecular study on two GCDH disease-related variants, GCDH-p.Arg227Pro and GCDH-p.Val400Met. Heterozygous patients harbouring these two mutations have increased residual enzymatic activity in relation to homozygous patients with only one of the mutations, suggesting a complementation effect between the two. Combining biochemical, biophysical and structural methods we here establish the effects of these mutations on protein folding, stability and catalytic activity. We show that both variants retain the overall protein fold, but with compromised enzymatic activities. Detailed enzyme kinetic studies reveal that GCDH-p.Arg227Pro has impaired function due to deficient substrate affinity as evidenced by its higher Km, and that the lower activity in GCDH-p.Val400Met results from weaker interactions with its physiological redox partner (electron transfer flavoprotein). Moreover, the GCDH-p.Val400Met variant has a significantly lower thermal stability (ΔTm ≈ 9 °C), and impaired binding of the FAD cofactor in relation to wild-type protein. On these grounds, we provide a rational for the possible interallelic complementation observed in heterozygous patients based on the fact that in GCDH, the low active p.Arg227Pro variant contributes to stabilize the tetramer while the structurally unstable p.Val400Met variant compensates for enzyme activity.","dc:creator":"Ribeiro JV","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Potential complementation effects of two disease-associated mutations in tetrameric glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase is due to inter subunit stability-activity counterbalance."},"rdfs:label":"GCDH p.Arg227Pro/p.Val400Met complementation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:33a2c95e-a057-4b93-b97e-27b6597516e5_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f867da03-bdbe-4f1f-b5d0-a94f264fe68a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2b643ab1-db7b-4136-950f-7b66902a752d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"In the first report (Koeller et al, 2002, PMID 15505386), Gcdh knock out mice were not found to develop striatal degeneration typical of the human disease, either spontaneously or when exposed to metabolic or infectious stressors.

Untreated patients suffer primarily from severe striatal damage. More than 250 variants in the GCDH gene have been reported with a variable frequency among different ethnic groups. In this study, we aimed to characterize 89 Egyptian patients with GA1 and identify the variants in the 41 patients who were available for genotyping. All of our patients demonstrated clinical, neuroradiological, and biochemical characteristics that are consistent with a diagnosis of GA1. All patients presented with variable degrees of developmental delay ranging from mild to severe. Most of the 89 patients presented with acute onset type (71.9%), followed by insidious (19%) and asymptomatic (9%). A delay in diagnosis was inversely associated with macrocephaly. The prevalence rate ratio (PR) for macrocephaly that was associated with each 6-month delay was 0.95 (95%CI 0.91-0.99). However, high body weight was associated with a higher likelihood of having macrocephaly (PR 1.16, 95%CI 1.06-1.26 per 1 SD increment of Z score weight). However, body weight was inversely associated with the morbidity score. Consanguinity level was 64% among our patient's cohort and was positively associated with the C5DC level (β (95%CI) 1.06 (0.12-1.99)). Forty-one patients were available for genotyping and were sequenced for the GCDH gene. We identified a total of 25 variants, of which the following six novel variants were identified: three missense variants, c.320G > T (p.Gly107Val), c.481C > T (p.Arg161Trp) and c.572 T > G (p.Met191Arg); two deletions, c.78delG (p.Ala27Argfs34) and c.1035delG (p.Gly346Alafs*11); and one indel, c.272_331del (p.Val91_Lys111delinsGlu). All of the novel variants were absent in the 300 normal chromosomes. The most common variant, c.*165A > G, was detected in 42 alleles, and the most commonly detected missense variant, c.1204C > T (p.Arg402Trp), was identified in 29 mutated alleles in 15/41 (34.2%) of patients. Our findings suggest that GA1 is not uncommon organic acidemia disease in Egypt; therefore, there is a need for supporting neonatal screening programs in Egypt.","dc:creator":"Zayed H","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Clinical, biochemical, neuroradiological and molecular characterization of Egyptian patients with glutaric acidemia type 1."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31062211","rdfs:label":"P31"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:f8a9f37d-9a04-4069-99eb-ec3cd7c8aea7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e46d9bb9-ffd4-4cb6-8e61-915b14d53b66","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Sequence analysis of GCDH from cDNA from whole blood.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosed with GA-1 based on clinical presentation, neuroimaging and biochemical measurements.

GCDH encodes glutaryl CoA dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial matrix enzyme composed of four identical subunits. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of glutaryl-CoA - an intermediate in the metabolism of lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan - to crotonyl-CoA and carbon dioxide. Deficiency of GCDH activity causes glutaric acidemia type 1 (GA-1), an autosomal recessive disorder. GA-1 is characterized by macrocephaly, acute encephalopathic crises and progressive movement disorders caused by striatal degeneration, typically with onset between the ages of 6-18 months, and often triggered by an intercurrent infection. Affected individuals present with elevated levels of glutaric acid, 3-hydroxy-glutaric acid, glutaconic acid and glutarylcarnitine and be classified as high excreters or low excreters based on the urine glutaric acid level (Larson and Goodman, 2019, PMID 31536184). Biallelic variants in GCDH were first reported in 1995 (Greenberg et al, PMID 7795610; Goodman et al, PMID 8541831). Since then, around 200 variants have been identified in GCDH. Data from 9 probands who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for GCDH variants were curated, including 9 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing) (Greenberg et al, 1995, PMID  7795610; Goodman et al, 1995, PMID 8541831; Anikster et al, 1996, PMID 8900228; Moseilhy et al, 2017, PMID 27476540; Zayed et al, 2019, PMID 31062211). One of these variants, c.91+5G>T, segregates in multiple closely related kindreds of an Ojibway-speaking genetic isolate of native Americans living in the Island Lake region of northern Manitoba and nearby communities of northwestern Ontario. (Greenberg et al, 1995, PMID 7795610). An inframe deletion with a dominant-negative impact has also been reported (PMID 22231382). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of GCDH which is consistent with the biochemical abnormalities observed in individuals with GCDH deficiency (PMIDs 8287562, 8541831); functional studies (Bross et al, 2012, PMID 22231382; Ribeiro et al, 2019, PMID 31491587), the biochemical and clinical features of a Gcdh knock out mouse (Koeller et al, 2002, PMID 11854167; Zinnanti et al, 2006, PMID 16446282) and biochemical findings in the Egyptian fruit-eating bat which has GCDH deficiency in liver and kidney (McMillan et al, 1998, PMID 3182847). In summary, GCDH is definitively associated with glutaryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (GA-1). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:33a2c95e-a057-4b93-b97e-27b6597516e5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
