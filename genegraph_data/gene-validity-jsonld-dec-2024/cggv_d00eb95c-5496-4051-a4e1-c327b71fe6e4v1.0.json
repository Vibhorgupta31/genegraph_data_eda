Using marker-assisted mapping in multiple families from a founder population and traditional coding exon sequencing of positional candidate genes, we identified three different mutations in the gene encoding ORC4, a component of the eukaryotic origin recognition complex, in five individuals with Meier-Gorlin syndrome. In two such individuals that were negative for mutations in ORC4, we found potential mutations in ORC1 and CDT1, two other genes involved in origin recognition. ORC4 is well conserved in eukaryotes, and the yeast equivalent of the human ORC4 missense mutation was shown to be pathogenic in functional assays of cell growth.

The essential role of ORC is to license origins during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, but ORC has also been implicated in several nonreplicative functions. Because of its essential role in DNA replication, ORC is required for every cell division during development.

Mutations in ATR, which also functions during replication, can cause Seckel syndrome, a clinically related disorder. These findings suggest that impaired DNA replication could underlie the developmental defects characteristic of these disorders. Here, we show that although origin licensing capacity is impaired in all patient cells with mutations in origin licensing component proteins, this does not correlate with the rate of progression through S phase. Thus, the replicative capacity in MGS patient cells does not correlate with clinical manifestation. However, ORC1-deficient cells from MGS patients and siRNA-mediated depletion of origin licensing proteins also have impaired centrosome and centriole copy number. As a novel and unexpected finding, we show that they also display a striking defect in the rate of formation of primary cilia. We demonstrate that this impacts sonic hedgehog signalling in ORC1-deficient primary fibroblasts. Additionally, reduced growth factor-dependent signaling via primary cilia affects the kinetics of cell cycle progression following cell cycle exit and re-entry, highlighting an unexpected mechanism whereby origin licensing components can influence cell cycle progression. Finally, using a cell-based model, we show that defects in cilia function impair chondroinduction. Our findings raise the possibility that a reduced efficiency in forming cilia could contribute to the clinical features of MGS, particularly the bone development abnormalities, and could provide a new dimension for considering developmental impacts of licensing deficiency.","dc:creator":"Stiff T","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Deficiency in origin licensing proteins impairs cilia formation: implications for the aetiology of Meier-Gorlin syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Stiff_Biochemical "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:d00eb95c-5496-4051-a4e1-c327b71fe6e4_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:900a69dd-a3e6-46af-a6db-b5b2f2d98dcf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f07cc068-9290-4bb9-8cca-36941b677d8f","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"âˆ¼5% of the EBV plasmids underwent replication in control cells but this was markedly reduced in ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1, and CDC6-deficient LBLs.

Meier-Gorlin syndrome 4 is a syndromic disorder characterized by short stature, â€‹â€‹missing patellae, small ears, and microcephaly. Many individuals also have distinctive facial features, with small, low set ears, microstomia, micrognathia, full lips, and a narrow nose with a high nasal bridge. At least two missense, one intragenic deletion, one frameshift, and one nonsense variant have been reported in four probands in two publications (PMID: 21358631; Marinakis et al., 2021, PMID: 34008892).
