We report detailed mapping in extended TAPVR kindreds and mutation analysis in TAPVR patients that implicate the PDGFRA gene in the development of TAPVR. Gene expression studies in mouse and chick embryos for both the Pdgfra receptor and its ligand Pdgf-a show temporal and spatial patterns consistent with a role in pulmonary vein (PV) development. We used an in ovo function blocking assay in chick and a conditional knockout approach in mouse to knock down Pdgfra expression in the developing venous pole during the period of PV formation. We observed that loss of PDGFRA function in both organisms causes TAPVR with low penetrance (approximately 7%) reminiscent of that observed in our human TAPVR kindreds. Intermediate inflow tract anomalies occurred in a higher percentage of embryos (approximately 30%), suggesting that TAPVR occurs at one end of a spectrum of defects. We show that the anomalous pulmonary venous connection seen in chick and mouse is highly similar to TAPVR discovered in an abnormal early stage embryo from the Kyoto human embryo collection. Whereas the embryology of the normal venous pole and PV is becoming understood, little is known about the embryogenesis or molecular pathogenesis of TAPVR. These models of TAPVR provide important insight into the pathogenesis of PV defects. Taken together, these data from human genetics and animal models support a role for PDGF-signaling in normal PV development, and in the pathogenesis of TAPVR.","dc:creator":"Bleyl SB","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Dysregulation of the PDGFRA gene causes inflow tract anomalies including TAPVR: integrating evidence from human genetics and model organisms."},"rdfs:label":"NCBI Fetal Expression (not from this PMID)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:f40d874e-0c34-4ff6-8145-4b310a67a033_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6eb3a33b-639a-4acb-affb-18b39953c419","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd5d946c-edcf-4510-bf26-ba9eff3d7442","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"TAPVR is a type of congenital heart disease ","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20071345","rdfs:label":"Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Downgrading due to low penetrance and only one human CHD case associated with gene (not TAPVR)"},{"id":"cggv:cd9c25a0-768f-431a-973b-01e140c2707b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e466b3c-00c1-4513-a960-910506fd1161","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"TAPVR is a type of congenital heart disease ","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20071345","rdfs:label":"Chick model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Downgrading due to low penetrance and only one human CHD case associated with gene (not TAPVR)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:f40d874e-0c34-4ff6-8145-4b310a67a033_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":8003,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":3,"subject":{"id":"cggv:13f97b57-5761-4a5b-a6ac-8b64d8b559dd","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005453","gene":"hgnc:8803","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"PDGFRA was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant congenital heart disease in 2021 (Morton et al., PMID: 33084842).

This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (a mouse model, a chick model, and NCBI fetal expression; PMID: 20071345). The animal models were not scored at full value due to low penetrance of congenital heart disease in the mutants. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
