Inherited deficiency of this enzyme causes the human genetic disease hereditary coproporphyria. Recently, we isolated, sequenced and expressed the cDNA encoding human coproporphyrinogen oxidase. This allowed us to investigate the nature of the defect leading to a profound deficiency of coproporphyrinogen oxidase in a patient with homozygous hereditary coproporphyria. Using reverse-transcription, amplification of the cDNA and direct sequencing of the amplified products, we found a point mutation resulted in an arginine to tryptophane substitution (R231W). Expression studies of normal and mutated cDNAs in a bacterial system demonstrated that this substitution resulted in the synthesis of an unstable protein with a residual catalytic activity. This is the first mutation to be found at the coproporphyrinogen oxidase locus. Furthermore, three common polymorphisms within the coproporphyrinogen oxidase gene were detected. Two DNA polymorphisms resulted in amino acids changes (H172N and V194I) and the third one was silent (E230E).","dc:creator":"Martasek P","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Homozygous hereditary coproporphyria caused by an arginine to tryptophane substitution in coproporphyrinogen oxidase and common intragenic polymorphisms."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f7cfd579-9ded-4e8a-b8be-c1a6e573e28b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f7cfd579-9ded-4e8a-b8be-c1a6e573e28b_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:376fef97-d57a-4bc0-b1d5-81956755b282","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f86eae61-df46-4299-b91e-030e91025282","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"HMBS encodes the porphyrinogen deaminase enzyme (PMID: 6975621) while UROD encodes the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme (PMID: 6370830).","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8407975","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Coproporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.3), the enzyme involved in the sixth step of heme biosynthesis, was purified to apparent homogeneity from bovine liver; it has a molecular mass of 37,000 daltons.

Two degenerate oligonucleotides based on the sequences of trypsin-digested peptides were used in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify a 198-base pair fragment of coproporphyrinogen oxidase DNA, using bovine kidney cells cDNA as a starting template. This fragment was used as a hybridization probe to isolate full-length coproporphyrinogen oxidase clones from a mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cell cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that coproporphyrinogen oxidase comprises 354 amino acid residues (M(r) 40,647), with a putative leader sequence of 31 amino acid residues, the result being a mature protein of 323 amino acid residues (M(r) 37,255).

Treatment of MEL cells with dimethyl sulfoxide led to an increase in coproporphyrinogen oxidase mRNA within 10 h, the induction reached a maximum at 24 h, and was in parallel with the induction of ferrochelatase mRNA.

The CPOX cDNA-transfected cells had sevenfold higher CPOX activity than cells transfected with vector only. Expression of ferrochelatase and heme content in the transfected cells increased slightly compared with the control. When K562 cells overexpressing CPOX were treated with delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), most became benzidine-positive without induction of the expression of CPOX or ferrochelatase, and the heme content was about twofold higher than that in ALA-treated control cells. Increases in cellular heme concomitant with a marked induction of the expression of heme-biosynthetic enzymes, including CPOX, ferrochelatase and erythroid-specific delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase, as well as of alpha-globin synthesis, were observed when cells were treated with transforming growth factor (TGF)beta 1. These increases in the transfected cells were twice those in control cells, indicating that overexpression of CPOX enhanced induction of the differentiation of K562 cells mediated by TGF beta 1 or ALA. Conversely, the transfection of antisense oligonucleotide to human CPOX mRNA into untreated and TGF beta 1-treated K562 cells led to a decrease in heme production compared with sense oligonucleotide-transfected cells.

Hereditary coproporphyria (HC) is an acute hepatic porphyria with autosomal dominant inheritance caused by deficient activity of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (COX). Typical clinical manifestations of the disease are acute attacks of neurological dysfunction; skin photosensitivity may also be present. We report a variant form of HC characterized by a unifying syndrome in which hematologic disorders predominate: harderoporphyria. Harderoporphyric patients exhibit jaundice, severe chronic hemolytic anemia of early onset associated with hepatosplenomegaly, and skin photosensitivity. Neither abdominal pain nor neuropsychiatric symptoms are observed. COX activity is markedly decreased. In a first harderoporphyric family, with three affected siblings, a homozygous K404E mutation has been previously characterized. In the present study, molecular investigations in a second family with neonatal hemolytic anemia and harderoporphyria revealed two heterozygous point mutations in the COX gene. One allele bore the missense mutation K404E previously described. The second allele bore an A-->G transition at the third position of the donor splice site in intron 6. This new COX gene mutation resulted in exon 6 skipping and the absence of functional protein production. In contrast with other COX gene defects that produce the classical hepatic porphyria presentation, our data suggest that the K404E substitution (either in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state associated with a mutation leading to the absence of functional mRNA or protein) is responsible for the specific hematologic clinical manifestations of harderoporphyria.","dc:creator":"Lamoril J","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Neonatal hemolytic anemia due to inherited harderoporphyria: clinical characteristics and molecular basis."}},{"id":"cggv:6aed1a24-f0f2-468f-bcc8-2d8daa2f4bb6_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:532e8646-b64d-41bd-a37d-f234a7503582"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicCompoundHeterozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9454777"}],"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicCompoundHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Lamoril_1998_Patient_1"},{"id":"cggv:10b5a7b2-b498-4c62-9a16-3422b8ba6784","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:10b5a7b2-b498-4c62-9a16-3422b8ba6784_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:10b5a7b2-b498-4c62-9a16-3422b8ba6784_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"NM_000097.7(CPOX):c.1277+3A>G is a paternally inherited donor splice site variant in intron 6 that has been shown to cause exon 6 skipping in the patient cDNA (Figure 2).

It results from mutations in the CPO gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme, coproporphyrinogen oxidase. A few patients have also been reported who are homoallellic or heteroallelic for CPO mutations and are clinically distinct from those with HCP. In such patients the presence of a specific mutation (K404E) on one or both alleles produces a neonatal hemolytic anemia that is known as \"harderoporphyria\"; mutations on both alleles elsewhere in the gene give rise to the \"homozygous\" variant of HCP. The molecular relationship between these disorders and HCP has not been defined. We describe the molecular investigation and clinical features of 17 unrelated British patients with HCP. Ten novel and four previously reported CPO mutations, together with three previously unrecognized single-nucleotide polymorphisms, were identified in 15 of the 17 patients. HCP is more heterogeneous than other acute porphyrias, with all but one mutation being restricted to a single family, with a predominance of missense mutations (10 missense, 2 nonsense, 1 frameshift, and 1 splice site). Of the four known mutations, one (R331W) has previously been reported to cause disease only in homozygotes. Heterologous expression of another mutation (R401W) demonstrated functional properties similar to those of the K404E harderoporphyria mutation. In all patients, clinical presentation was uniform, in spite of the wide range (1%-64%) of residual coproporphyrinogen oxidase activity, as determined by heterologous expression. Our findings add substantially to knowledge of the molecular epidemiology of HCP, show that single copies of CPO mutations that are known or predicted to cause \"homozygous\" HCP or harderoporphyria can produce typical HCP in adults, and demonstrate that the severity of the phenotype does not correlate with the degree of inactivation by mutation of coproporphyrinogen oxidase.","dc:creator":"Lamoril J","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Characterization of mutations in the CPO gene in British patients demonstrates absence of genotype-phenotype correlation and identifies relationship between hereditary coproporphyria and harderoporphyria."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Lamoril_2001_Patient_1"},{"id":"cggv:f4c15825-1095-411e-8fac-652f11d59f4e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f4c15825-1095-411e-8fac-652f11d59f4e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:f4c15825-1095-411e-8fac-652f11d59f4e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"NM_000097.7:c.1201C>T (p.Lys401Glu) is a missense variant in exon 6 of 7 that has only 63% of wild-type enzymatic function when expressed in E. coli, leading to increased harderoporphyrin production in this system (Table 2, Figure 3)."}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This variant has been up-scored due to the functional evidence of a deleterious effect on the protein product."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2118ad30-88e1-4a3a-ac5c-eba31ef6b664_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2118ad30-88e1-4a3a-ac5c-eba31ef6b664","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:b334b3bb-28d7-468d-8b10-23ca82bca0b3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000003.12:g.98588750G>A (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA353645374"}},"detectionMethod":"PCR amplified exons and flanking regions from the CPOX locus were screened for mutations by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), followed by Sanger sequencing to identify variants.","firstTestingMethod":"Denaturing gradient gel","phenotypeFreeText":"The patient has been diagnosed with hereditary coproporphyria based on a history of 1-3 acute attacks triggered by drugs, fasting, hormonal changes, or infection (unspecified), and has 50% decreased CPOX enzymatic activity in lymphocytes.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002574","obo:HP_0032999","obo:HP_0003163","obo:HP_0002017","obo:HP_0033010","obo:HP_0002572","obo:HP_0010473"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"Genotyping was limited to the CPOX locus alone.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:44c34b63-3f86-4915-9e8d-87c79a8dfd2b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:b334b3bb-28d7-468d-8b10-23ca82bca0b3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9888388","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hereditary coproporphyria (HC) is an acute hepatic porphyria with autosomal dominant inheritance caused by deficient activity of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO). Clinical manifestations of the disease are characterized by acute attacks of neurological dysfunction often precipitated by drugs, fasting, cyclical hormonal changes, or infectious diseases. Skin photosensitivity may also be present. The seven exons, the exon/intron boundaries and part of 3' noncoding sequence of the CPO gene were systematically analyzed by an exon-by-exon denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) strategy followed by direct sequencing in seven unrelated heterozygous HC patients from France, Holland, and Czech Republic. Seven novel mutations and two new polymorphisms were detected. Among these mutations: two are missense (G197W, W427R), two are nonsense (Q306X, Q385X), two are small deletions (662de14bp; 1168del3bp removing a glycine at position 390), and one is a splicing mutation (IVS1-15c-->g) which creates a new acceptor splice site. The pathological significance of the point mutations G197W, W427R, and the in-frame deletion 390delGly were assessed by their respective expression in a prokaryotic system using site-directed mutagenesis. These mutations resulted in the absence or a dramatic decrease of CPO activity. The two polymorphisms were localized in noncoding part of the gene: 1) a C/G polymorphism in the promotor region, 142 bp upstream from the transcriptional initiation site (-142C/G), and 2) a 6 bp deletion polymorphism in the 3' noncoding part of the CPO gene, 574 bp downstream of the last base of the normal termination codon (+574 delATTCTT). Five intragenic dimorphisms are now well characterized and the high degree of allelic heterogeneity in HC is demonstrated with seven new different mutations making a total of nineteen CPO gene defects reported so far.","dc:creator":"Rosipal R","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Systematic analysis of coproporphyrinogen oxidase gene defects in hereditary coproporphyria and mutation update."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Rosipal_1999_Patient_P4"},{"id":"cggv:44c34b63-3f86-4915-9e8d-87c79a8dfd2b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:44c34b63-3f86-4915-9e8d-87c79a8dfd2b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"NM_000097.5:c.916C>T (p.Gln306Ter) is a nonsense variant in exon 4 of 7 that is predicted to trigger nonsense-mediated decay or to at least disrupt the C-terminal 33% of the protein product."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0dc9c6c4-5905-4959-8462-c59c5e3b2197_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0dc9c6c4-5905-4959-8462-c59c5e3b2197","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:d5f110cb-1f92-4f92-bb3f-10f672ed722c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000097.7(CPOX):c.857C>A (p.Thr286Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA353645510"}},"detectionMethod":"The patient was initially genotyped by Sanger sequencing of the CPOX locus., followed by whole exome sequencing to attempt to identify potential modifiers.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Admitted while symptomatic","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0010473","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"The patient was initially genotyped by Sanger sequencing of the CPOX locus.","secondTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:68d81804-e566-4199-9e16-eef9764d158c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d5f110cb-1f92-4f92-bb3f-10f672ed722c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27507172","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hereditary porphyrias are caused by mutations in genes that encode haem biosynthetic enzymes with resultant buildup of cytotoxic metabolic porphyrin intermediates. A long-standing open question is why the same causal porphyria mutations exhibit widely variable penetrance and expressivity in different individuals. Here we show that severely affected porphyria patients harbour variant alleles in the ABCB6 gene, also known as Lan, which encodes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. Plasma membrane ABCB6 exports a variety of disease-related porphyrins. Functional studies show that most of these ABCB6 variants are expressed poorly and/or have impaired function. Accordingly, homozygous disruption of the Abcb6 gene in mice exacerbates porphyria phenotypes in the Fech(m1Pas) mouse model, as evidenced by increased porphyrin accumulation, and marked liver injury. Collectively, these studies support ABCB6 role as a genetic modifier of porphyria and suggest that porphyrin-inducing drugs may produce excessive toxicities in individuals with the rare Lan(-) blood type.","dc:creator":"Fukuda Y","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"The severity of hereditary porphyria is modulated by the porphyrin exporter and Lan antigen ABCB6."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Fukuda_2016_1"},{"id":"cggv:68d81804-e566-4199-9e16-eef9764d158c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:68d81804-e566-4199-9e16-eef9764d158c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"The variant has been scored at the default level due to an absence of functional data showing an effect on the gene product."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ddf91c73-ff95-4c78-b045-12dee89ef8f8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ddf91c73-ff95-4c78-b045-12dee89ef8f8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:cc977362-63cd-460a-92c0-b9478ceba296","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000097.7(CPOX):c.991C>T (p.Arg331Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA114296"}},"detectionMethod":"The patient was genotyped by Sanger sequencing of the cDNA from the CPOX locus.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"The proband was diagnosed with homozygous hereditary coproporphyria.

A more diverse range of affected individuals have since emerged harboring either biallelic or monoallelic variants in *CPOX*. Cases with monoallelic variants are generally diagnosed with hereditary coporphyria and exhibit incomplete penetrance, with the majority of carriers likely remaining unaffected throughout their lifetimes. Affected individuals generally present with an acute attack of abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, sometimes accompanied by other gastrointestinal, neurological, and/or psychiatric symptoms (PMID: 12227458). Onset of such an attack typically occurs during adolescence or later, and can be triggered by barbiturate or sulfonamide drugs known to activate heme synthesis or by low caloric intake, infection, alcohol consumption, or hormones. These monoallelic cases are distinguished from other forms of porphyria at the metabolic level, where symptomatic patients not only exhibit elevated urinary levels of delta-aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, and/or related porphyrin metabolites, but also increased accumulation of coproporphyrin III, particularly in feces. While lymphocytes from monoallelic patients generally show a reduction in the activity of the CPOX enzyme to 50-70% of wild-type levels (PMID: 8990017, PMID: 9454777), those from biallelic patients retain 2-22% of wild-type CPOX activity (PMID: 8159699, PMID: 10505225, PMID: 9454777). Cases harboring biallelic *CPOX* variants are rare and fully penetrant, with neonatal or early childhood onset of a more severe set of phenotypes including jaundice, hemolytic anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, iron accumulation in liver cells, erythrodontia, red urine, fragile skin, and/or cutaneous photosensitivity leading to scarring of sun-exposed skin. While biallelic cases are metabolically similar to monoallelic cases in that they exhibit high levels of coproporphyrin in urine and especially in feces, a subset of biallelic cases show specific fecal accumulation of an intermediate product of the CPOX enzyme, harderoporphyrin, resulting in an alternative diagnosis of harderoporphyria (PMID: 7757079). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the molecular mechanism (CPOX loss-of-function) was found to be consistent between the hereditary coporphyria cases with either monoallelic or biallelic variants and the harderoporphyria cases with biallelic variants. In addition, the metabolic and phenotypic differences between the diverse cases (especially at the metabolic level) appeared to represent a single spectrum of disease. Therefore, cases caused by inherited *CPOX* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity referred to as *CPOX*-related hereditary coproporphyria (MONDO:0800180), with a semidominant mode of inheritance.\n\nFourteen suspected pathogenic variants have been scored as part of this curation (six missense, one single codon deletion, and four triggering splicing defects), which have been collectively reported in thirteen probands in nine publications (PMID: 8012360, PMID: 8990017, PMID: 10505225, PMID: 9454777, PMID: 7757079, PMID: 11309681, PMID: 9888388, PMID: 27507172, PMID: 35669728). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be monoallelic or biallelic loss of CPOX function conferred by null and/or hypomorphic variants. Seven out of eleven probands were heterozygous for their respective variants, harboring either a predicted null or a hypomorphic variant, while none of the published biallelic cases harbored two alleles predicted to result in complete loss of function (PMID: 8012360, PMID: 10505225, PMID: 9454777, PMID: 7757079). Segregation evidence was available in one of these publications (PMID: 7757079) but was not sufficient to contribute to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship. Additional case-level evidence is available in the literature but was not included in this curation as the maximum score for this category of evidence had already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence demonstrating that *CPOX* encodes the human coproporphyrinogen oxidase enzyme responsible for catalyzing protoporphyrinogen IX synthesis from coproporphyrinogen III (PMID: 8407975). This represents the sixth step in the heme biosynthesis pathway and is consistent with the accumulation of coproporphyrin III in the feces and urine of affected patients. Porphyria-causing variants are also found in the *HMBS* gene encoding the porphyrinogen deaminase enzyme (PMID: 6975621) and the *UROD* gene encoding the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme (PMID: 6370830), which respectively catalyze the third and fifth steps in the heme biosynthesis pathway. *CPOX* silencing in a lymphoblast cell line decreases heme synthesis (PMID: 11248690). Mutagenized mouse models have shown that monoallelic *Cpox* loss-of-function can recapitulate some of the metabolic defects observed in heterozygous human patients, including phenobarbital-induced elevation of urinary and fecal porphyrins (especially the ratio of coproporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen I), and also exhibit microcytic anemia (PMID: 28600349, PMID: 35527013).\n\nIn summary, *CPOX* is definitively associated with *CPOX*-related hereditary coproporphyria. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 9th, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f7cfd579-9ded-4e8a-b8be-c1a6e573e28b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
