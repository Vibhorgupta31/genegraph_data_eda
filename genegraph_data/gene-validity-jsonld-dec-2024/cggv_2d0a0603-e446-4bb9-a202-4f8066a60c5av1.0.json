Complex neurodevelopmental disorder in relation to variants in *KMT2E* was originally termed as O'Donnell-Luria-Rodan syndrome (ODLURO), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay, speech delay, variably delayed intellectual development, and subtle dysmorphic features. Some patients may also have autism, seizures, hypotonia, and/or feeding difficulties. Ten variants, mostly *de novo* (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, and frameshift), that have been reported in 10 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 31079897, 33111303, 35273928) are included in this curation. Of note, individuals with protein truncating variants tended to present with milder neurodevelopmental phenotypes in contrast to individuals with missense variants presented, who presented with epilepsy, including infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy, and more severe developmental delays. (O’Donnell-Luria et al., PMID: 31079897). More evidence is available in the literature, including chromosome 7q22.2-22.3 microdeletions involving KMT2E, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be LOF. At the time of this curation, there is no experimental evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. \n\nIn summary, *KMT2E* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism GCEP on the meeting date August 2, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2d0a0603-e446-4bb9-a202-4f8066a60c5a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
