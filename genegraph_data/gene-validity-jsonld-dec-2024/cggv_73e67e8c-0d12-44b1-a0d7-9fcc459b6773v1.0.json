Biallelic and monoallelic variants in *MUTYH* were linked to multiple types of cancer and/or tumor, including hereditary breast cancer, familial ovarian cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis and colorectal cancer. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have split these associations into different curations due to phenotypic differences and/or inheritance mechanism. Therefore, this curation solely focuses on autosomal recessive hereditary breast cancer. \n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 0 point** \nTo date, this gene-disease relationship has been studied in one large case-control study at the aggregate variant level in 2017 (PMID: 35172496). This study screened breast cancer cases from commercial laboratories and did not find significant association of biallelic variants in *MUTYH* with breast cancer. \n\n**Overall Summary:**\nIn summary, given that the only one case-control study showed no increased risk for breast cancer in biallelic *MUTYH* variant carriers, and no experimental data support this gene-disease relationship, the Hereditary Cancer GCEP has disputed this gene-disease association. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *MUTYH* plays in autosomal recessive hereditary breast cancer. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as no known disease relationship by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 05/24/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 06/23/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n\nGiven that the only one case-control study showed no increased risk for breast cancer in biallelic MUTYH variant carriers, and no experimental data support this gene-disease relationship, the Hereditary Cancer GCEP has disputed this gene-disease association.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:73e67e8c-0d12-44b1-a0d7-9fcc459b6773"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
