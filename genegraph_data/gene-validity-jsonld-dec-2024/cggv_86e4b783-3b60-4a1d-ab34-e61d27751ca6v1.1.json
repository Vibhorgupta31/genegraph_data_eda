Mutations in either KCNQ1 or KCNE1 genes produce the long-QT syndrome, a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. Here, we show that long-QT mutations located in the KCNQ1 C terminus impair calmodulin (CaM) binding, which affects both channel gating and assembly. The mutations produce a voltage-dependent macroscopic inactivation and dramatically alter channel assembly. KCNE1 forms a ternary complex with wild-type KCNQ1 and Ca(2+)-CaM that prevents inactivation, facilitates channel assembly, and mediates a Ca(2+)-sensitive increase of IKS-current, with a considerable Ca(2+)-dependent left-shift of the voltage-dependence of activation. Coexpression of KCNQ1 or IKS channels with a Ca(2+)-insensitive CaM mutant markedly suppresses the currents and produces a right shift in the voltage-dependence of channel activation. KCNE1 association to KCNQ1 long-QT mutants significantly improves mutant channel expression and prevents macroscopic inactivation. However, the marked right shift in channel activation and the subsequent decrease in current amplitude cannot restore normal levels of IKS channel activity. Our data indicate that in healthy individuals, CaM binding to KCNQ1 is essential for correct channel folding and assembly and for conferring Ca(2+)-sensitive IKS-current stimulation, which increases the cardiac repolarization reserve and hence prevents the risk of ventricular arrhythmias.","dc:creator":"Shamgar L","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Calmodulin is essential for cardiac IKS channel gating and assembly: impaired function in long-QT mutations."},"rdfs:label":"Multiple"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:86e4b783-3b60-4a1d-ab34-e61d27751ca6_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d1eaab93-ff83-4c8e-ae9c-b24ecc9f0a36","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:85b09455-d886-403f-ab75-3f7b8d209c2e","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"CALM2 mutation p.Asp60Val caused both increased action potential duration (APD) and heightened Ca2+ transients.

To date, however, no experimental evidence has established these mutations as directly causative of LQTS substrates, nor have the molecular targets of CaM mutants been identified. Here, therefore, we test whether expression of CaM mutants in adult guinea-pig ventricular myocytes (aGPVM) induces action-potential prolongation, and whether affiliated alterations in the Ca(2+) regulation of L-type Ca(2+) channels (LTCC) might contribute to such prolongation. In particular, we first overexpressed CaM mutants in aGPVMs, and observed both increased action potential duration (APD) and heightened Ca(2+) transients. Next, we demonstrated that all LQTS CaM mutants have the potential to strongly suppress Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent inactivation (CDI) of LTCCs, whether channels were heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells, or present in native form within myocytes. This attenuation of CDI is predicted to promote action-potential prolongation and boost Ca(2+) influx. Finally, we demonstrated how a small fraction of LQTS CaM mutants (as in heterozygous patients) would nonetheless suffice to substantially diminish CDI, and derange electrical and Ca(2+) profiles. In all, these results highlight LTCCs as a molecular locus for understanding and treating CaM-related LQTS in this group of patients.

Here, we investigated the effect of CaM mutations causing CPVT (N53I), long QT syndrome (D95V and D129G), or both (CaM N97S) on RyR2-mediated Ca(2+) release. All mutations increased Ca(2+) release and rendered RyR2 more susceptible to store overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR) by lowering the threshold of store Ca(2+) content at which SOICR occurred and the threshold at which SOICR terminated. To obtain mechanistic insights, we investigated the Ca(2+) binding of the N- and C-terminal domains (N- and C-domain) of CaM in the presence of a peptide corresponding to the CaM-binding domain of RyR2. The N53I mutation decreased the affinity of Ca(2+) binding to the N-domain of CaM, relative to CaM WT, but did not affect the C-domain. Conversely, mutations N97S, D95V, and D129G had little or no effect on Ca(2+) binding to the N-domain but markedly decreased the affinity of the C-domain for Ca(2+). These results suggest that mutations D95V, N97S, and D129G alter the interaction between CaM and the CaMBD and thus RyR2 regulation. Because the N53I mutation minimally affected Ca(2+) binding to the C-domain, it must cause aberrant regulation via a different mechanism. These results support aberrant RyR2 regulation as the disease mechanism for CPVT associated with CaM mutations and shows that CaM mutations not associated with CPVT can also affect RyR2. A model for the CaM-RyR2 interaction, where the Ca(2+)-saturated C-domain is constitutively bound to RyR2 and the N-domain senses increases in Ca(2+) concentration, is proposed.

Recently, mutations in CALM1-3 have been reported to be associated with severe early-onset long-QT syndrome (LQTS). However, the underlying mechanism through which heterozygous calmodulin mutations lead to severe LQTS remains unknown, particularly in human cardiomyocytes. We aimed to establish an LQTS disease model associated with a CALM2 mutation (LQT15) using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and to assess mutant allele-specific ablation by genome editing for the treatment of LQT15. We generated LQT15-hiPSCs from a 12-year-old boy with LQTS carrying a CALM2-N98S mutation and differentiated these hiPSCs into cardiomyocytes (LQT15-hiPSC-CMs). Action potentials (APs) and L-type Ca2+ channel (LTCC) currents in hiPSC-CMs were analyzed by the patch-clamp technique and compared with those of healthy controls. Furthermore, we performed mutant allele-specific knockout using a CRISPR-Cas9 system and analyzed electrophysiological properties. Electrophysiological analyses revealed that LQT15-hiPSC-CMs exhibited significantly lower beating rates, prolonged AP durations, and impaired inactivation of LTCC currents compared with control cells, consistent with clinical phenotypes. Notably, ablation of the mutant allele rescued the electrophysiological abnormalities of LQT15-hiPSC-CMs, indicating that the mutant allele caused dominant-negative suppression of LTCC inactivation, resulting in prolonged AP duration. We successfully recapitulated the disease phenotypes of LQT15 and revealed that inactivation of LTCC currents was impaired in CALM2-N98S hiPSC model. Additionally, allele-specific ablation using the latest genome-editing technology provided important insights into a promising therapeutic approach for inherited cardiac diseases.","dc:creator":"Yamamoto Y","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Allele-specific ablation rescues electrophysiological abnormalities in a human iPS cell model of long-QT syndrome with a CALM2 mutation."},"rdfs:label":"iPS + allele-specific ablation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:89aefac2-8114-488d-92e3-f3dcff50b724","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e59b35d6-2cd3-4dca-8d6b-7d5f2b52a28d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Shortening of APD","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27765793","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Calmodulinopathies comprise a new category of potentially life-threatening genetic arrhythmia syndromes capable of producing severe long-QT syndrome (LQTS) with mutations involving CALM1, CALM2, or CALM3.

An exactly identical calmodulin protein is encoded by 3 separate genes, CALM1-3, located on different chromosomes (14, 2 and 19, respectively). \nIn 2013 Crotti et al. were the first to identify de-novo missense variants in CALM1 and CALM2 in 2 patients with a unique phenotype (PMID 23388215). Both were infants presenting with marked QT prolongation, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and intermittent AV block. Subsequent studies identified multiple similar cases with de-novo variants in one of the 3 CALM genes. Based on this evidence the Expert Panel classified all calmoudulin genes (CALM1-3) as having a 'Definitive' level of evidence for disease causation of LQTS with atypical features presenting in childhood. \nNote: All LQTS genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams were reviewed by the LQTS Clinical Domain Expert Panel.
