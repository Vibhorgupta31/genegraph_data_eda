In neurons and microglia differentiated from PGRN S116X induced pluripotent stem cells, the levels of intracellular and secreted PGRN were reduced, establishing patient-specific cellular models of PGRN haploinsufficiency. Through a systematic screen of inducers of cellular stress, we found that PGRN S116X neurons, but not sporadic FTD neurons, exhibited increased sensitivity to staurosporine and other kinase inhibitors. Moreover, the serine/threonine kinase S6K2, a component of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, was specifically downregulated in PGRN S116X neurons. Both increased sensitivity to kinase inhibitors and reduced S6K2 were rescued by PGRN expression.

A major protein component of these inclusions is TDP-43, which becomes hyperphosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and cleaved to generate C-terminal fragments, which apparently translocate from nuclei to the cytoplasm. Most progranulin mutations are nonsense mutations resulting in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and consequently reduced progranulin protein levels. However, some missense mutations are described that occur within the signal sequence and mature progranulin. We now demonstrate that a progranulin mutation located within the signal sequence (PGRN A9D) results in cytoplasmic missorting with extremely low expression. In contrast, two other progranulin mutations (PGRN P248L and R432C) are expressed as immature proteins but are inefficiently transported through and partially degraded within the secretory pathway, resulting in a significantly reduced secretion. Thus apparently all progranulin mutations cause reduced protein expression or secretion, although by different cellular mechanisms. To investigate a putative relationship between reduced expression of progranulin and TDP-43 relocalization and deposition, we down-regulated progranulin in human cell lines and in zebrafish. Upon reduction of progranulin, neither a major redistribution of TDP-43 nor proteolytic processing to disease-characterizing C-terminal fragments could be observed.","dc:creator":"Shankaran SS","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Missense mutations in the progranulin gene linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions reduce progranulin production and secretion."},"rdfs:label":"HeLa cells transfected with wt PGRN, A9D, P2 48L, R432C"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2584cd12-7824-425c-acab-aac2e012b380","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:87054f73-88ee-4ac5-8d95-3e0cd07528e1","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"A9D mRNA is specifically degraded in patient-derived cells, and mRNA degradation is translation dependent\nDisruption of SRP (Signal recognition particle) recruitment triggers GRN mRNA degradation (SRP recruitment is important for mRNA stability).

Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in GRN, the progranulin gene, are a common genetic cause of the disorder, but the mechanisms by which progranulin haploinsufficiency causes neuronal dysfunction in FTD are unclear. Homozygous progranulin knock-out (Grn(-/-)) mice have been studied as a model of this disorder and show behavioral deficits and a neuroinflammatory phenotype with robust microglial activation. However, homozygous GRN mutations causing complete progranulin deficiency were recently shown to cause a different neurological disorder, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, suggesting that the total absence of progranulin may have effects distinct from those of haploinsufficiency. Here, we studied progranulin heterozygous (Grn(+/-)) mice, which model progranulin haploinsufficiency. We found that Grn(+/-) mice developed age-dependent social and emotional deficits potentially relevant to FTD. However, unlike Grn(-/-) mice, behavioral deficits in Grn(+/-) mice occurred in the absence of gliosis or increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-Î±. Instead, we found neuronal abnormalities in the amygdala, an area of selective vulnerability in FTD, in Grn(+/-) mice. Our findings indicate that FTD-related deficits resulting from progranulin haploinsufficiency can develop in the absence of detectable gliosis and neuroinflammation, thereby dissociating microglial activation from functional deficits and suggesting an important effect of progranulin deficiency on neurons.","dc:creator":"Filiano AJ","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Dissociation of frontotemporal dementia-related deficits and neuroinflammation in progranulin haploinsufficient mice."},"rdfs:label":"Progranulin Haploinsufficient Mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6401,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:121abaca-b43e-45d2-905e-61d6a702c151","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0030923","gene":"hgnc:4601","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Variants in theÂ *GRN*Â gene have been reported in relation to both autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia and autosomal recessive neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) (PMID: 16862116, 16862115, 22608501). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability for these assertions. Therefore, these assertions have been split into the following disease entities: autosomal dominant Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and/or Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and autosomal recessive neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). This curation for autosomal dominant ALS,  ALS-FTD and FTD does not include probands from autosomal recessive neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis\nHeterozygous loss of function variants (frameshift or nonsense) in the *GRN* gene have been commonly reported in individuals with FTD, however occasionally, missense variants seen in signal sequence or initiator codon result in low or absent PGRN protein, consistent with a loss-of-function mechanism of disease (PMIDs: 17436289, 18184915, 23596077, 32772750, 17436289, 18184915, 23596077, 32772750, 16862116, 16862115, 17436289, 18183624). In all instances of literature when available, affected probands withÂ *GRN*Â variants are identified to have low or absent PGRN consistent with a loss of function mechanism of disease â including the missense variant p.Ala9Asp. With the genetic evidence available in the literature, the score for genetic evidence for the ALS, ALS-FTD cases is 2.1, this is combined with the pure FTD cases to reach the maximum score for genetic evidence reached (12 points). It is emphasized that most of the evidence is from FTD but there are a handful of cases with MND phenotype. Evidence supporting this gene disease pair also includes experimental data from human cell lines and patient fibroblasts showing low expression of PGRN protein in addition to haploinsufficient FTD mouse model  (PMID: 17984093, 29874572, 23063362, 23516300). \nIn summary, *GRN* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
