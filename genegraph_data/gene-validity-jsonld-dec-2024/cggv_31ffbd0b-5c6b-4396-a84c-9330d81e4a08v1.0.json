Recently, we have mapped a gene for CFNS in the pericentromeric region of the X chromosome that contains the EFNB1 gene, which encodes the ephrin-B1 ligand for Eph receptors. Since Efnb1 mutant mice display a spectrum of malformations and an unusual inheritance reminiscent of CFNS, we analyzed the EFNB1 gene in three families with CFNS. In one family, a deletion of exons 2-5 was identified in an obligate carrier male, his mildly affected brother, and in the affected females. In the two other families, missense mutations in EFNB1 were detected that lead to amino acid exchanges P54L and T111I. Both mutations are located in multimerization and receptor-interaction motifs found within the ephrin-B1 extracellular domain. In all cases, mutations were found consistently in obligate male carriers, clinically affected males, and affected heterozygous females.

X-inactivation is proposed to explain the more severe outcome in heterozygous females, as this leads to functional mosaicism for cells with differing expression of EPHRIN-B1, generating abnormal tissue boundaries-a process that cannot occur in hemizygous males. Apparently challenging this model, males occasionally present with a more severe female-like CFNS phenotype. We hypothesized that such individuals might be mosaic for EFNB1 mutations and investigated this possibility in multiple tissue samples from six sporadically presenting males. Using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, massively parallel sequencing and multiplex-ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to increase sensitivity above standard dideoxy sequencing, we identified mosaic mutations of EFNB1 in all cases, comprising three missense changes, two gene deletions and a novel point mutation within the 5' untranslated region (UTR). Quantification by Pyrosequencing and MLPA demonstrated levels of mutant cells between 15 and 69%. The 5' UTR variant mutates the stop codon of a small upstream open reading frame that, using a dual-luciferase reporter construct, was demonstrated to exacerbate interference with translation of the wild-type protein. These results demonstrate a more severe outcome in mosaic than in constitutionally deficient males in an X-linked dominant disorder and provide further support for the cellular interference mechanism, normally related to X-inactivation in females.","dc:creator":"Twigg SR","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Cellular interference in craniofrontonasal syndrome: males mosaic for mutations in the X-linked EFNB1 gene are more severely affected than true hemizygotes."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23335590","rdfs:label":"Subject 4021"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:ed8c21ed-d94e-456b-8086-90337d606fd8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eaf02a49-a61a-41ea-bbaf-0a4d291c2e66","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0011324","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:ed8c21ed-d94e-456b-8086-90337d606fd8_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:d5ad28ca-e6e4-4d23-9473-217e0780acf0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004429.4(EFNB1):c.614_615del (p.Ser205Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139532310"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29215649","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The craniosynostoses are characterized by premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures.

Here, we show that the classical female CFNS phenotype is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in EFNB1, which encodes a member of the ephrin family of transmembrane ligands for Eph receptor tyrosine kinases. In mice, the orthologous Efnb1 gene is expressed in the frontonasal neural crest and demarcates the position of the future coronal suture. Although EFNB1 is X-inactivated, we did not observe markedly skewed X-inactivation in either blood or cranial periosteum from females with CFNS, indicating that lack of ephrin-B1 does not compromise cell viability in these tissues. We propose that in heterozygous females, patchwork loss of ephrin-B1 disturbs tissue boundary formation at the developing coronal suture, whereas in males deficient in ephrin-B1, an alternative mechanism maintains the normal boundary.

The study of naturally occurring human EFNB1 mutations offers a unique opportunity to better define the critical portion within the ephrin domain that is essential for the function of EFNB1 protein in craniofacial development. Here, we report a CFNS patient with a novel EFNB1 missense mutation present at the interface between EFNB1 and its receptor proteins. The patient's facial features included hypertelorism, a broad nasal tip, brachycephaly, frontal bossing, facial asymmetry and esotropia. In addition, she had pectus carinatum, grooved nails on her thumb, an abnormal palmar crease pattern and a broad first toe. Her development was appropriate for her age. Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products using an autosequencer revealed a heterozygous missense mutation, Ser118Ile. Ser118 is located in the G-H loop of the extracellular ephrin domain and is highly evolutionarily conserved among rodents, avians and fish. The mutation occurred de novo and was not present in 100 normal Japanese control subjects. Substitutions of the adjacent amino acid residue, Pro119, have been previously reported in three CFNS patients. Since the structure of EFNB1 is not yet available, the spatial locality of Ser118 was characterized using the protein structure of EFNB2. We deduced that Ser118 in EFNB1 resides at the major dimerization interface with Eph receptors and inferred that the Ser118Ile mutation may impede the protrusion of the G-H loop, thereby disturbing Eph-Ephrin signal transduction.","dc:creator":"Torii C","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"EFNB1 mutation at the ephrin ligand-receptor dimerization interface in a patient with craniofrontonasal syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17300690","rdfs:label":"Torii et al. proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded for consistency with SOP v8."},{"id":"cggv:7cc2d2ca-682e-44df-a96d-5d88bb233ab5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ca86c4fc-1188-4ba7-9080-520883c3900e","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0004440","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:7cc2d2ca-682e-44df-a96d-5d88bb233ab5_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:87f06f2d-e9f7-4ff4-89e0-4c175c449d45"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15166289"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15166289","rdfs:label":"Proband 344"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:2a5a4869-34eb-4aa7-8543-8293c563b393_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:78cf1b27-d88c-4a0c-927f-e32af8e0467f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":26,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"In addition to craniofacial features, this proband had nail splitting, bilateral duplication of the kidneys and ureters, and duplication of the uterus.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001807","obo:HP_0012210","obo:HP_0001363","obo:HP_0000130"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:2a5a4869-34eb-4aa7-8543-8293c563b393_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:0eddee17-ccd7-4689-acda-28dcad1c667a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004429.4(EFNB1):c.407-2A>T (p.=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA413437892"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15959873","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Craniofrontonasal syndrome (CFNS) is an X-linked disorder characterized by a more severe manifestation in heterozygous females than in hemizygous males. Heterozygous females have craniofrontonasal dysplasia (CFND) and occasionally extracranial manifestations including midline defects and skeletal abnormalities, whereas hemizygous males show no or only mild features such as hypertelorism and rarely show cleft lip or palate. Mutations in the EFNB1 gene in Xq12 are responsible for familial and sporadic CFNS. The EFNB1 gene encodes ephrin-B1, a transmembrane ligand that also exhibits receptor-like effects. We performed mutation analysis in nine unrelated families and 29 sporadic patients with CFNS. DNA sequencing revealed mutations in 33 (86.8%) cases including 26 distinct novel mutations. A recurrent nonsense mutation, c.196C>T/R66X, was detected in one family and four sporadic patients. The majority of mutations (26/33) were located in exons 2 and 3 of the EFNB1 gene encoding the extracellular ephrin domain. The mutation spectrum includes frameshift, nonsense, missense, and splice site mutations, with a predominance of frameshift and nonsense mutations resulting in premature truncation codons. For the first time we describe mutations in exons 4 and 5 of EFNB1. Of particular interest are the frameshift mutations located in the last 25 codons of EFNB1 encoding the carboxyterminal end of ephrin-B1. They result in an extension by 44 residues. These mutations disrupt the intracellular binding sites for Grb4 and PDZ-effector proteins involved in reverse signaling.

In ephrin-B1 heterozygous mutants, X inactivation generates ephrin-B1-expressing and -nonexpressing cells that sort out, resulting in mosaic ephrin-B1 expression. We now show that this process leads to mosaic disruption of cell proliferation and post-transcriptional up-regulation of EphB receptor expression through relief of endocytosis and degradation. The alteration in proliferation rates resulting from ectopic Eph-ephrin expression boundaries correlates with the more severe dysmorphogenesis of ephrin-B1(+/-) heterozygotes that is a hallmark of CFNS.

Craniofrontonasal syndrome is generally more severe in heterozygous females than in hemizygous males; however, mosaic males with severe phenotypes have been reported. More than 115 unique variants (including missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice site, and multi-exon deletions) in EFNB1 have been seen in humans.
