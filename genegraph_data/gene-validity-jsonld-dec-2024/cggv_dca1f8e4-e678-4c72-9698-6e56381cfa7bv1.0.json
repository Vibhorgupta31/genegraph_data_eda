Defective RNase H2 may induce accumulation of self-nucleic acid species that trigger chronic type I interferon and inflammatory responses, leading to AGS pathology. We created a knock-in mouse model with an RNase H2 AGS mutation in a highly conserved residue of the catalytic subunit, Rnaseh2a(G37S/G37S) (G37S), to understand disease pathology. G37S homozygotes are perinatal lethal, in contrast to the early embryonic lethality previously reported for Rnaseh2b- or Rnaseh2c-null mice. Importantly, we found that the G37S mutation led to increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes dependent on the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Ablation of STING in the G37S mice results in partial rescue of the perinatal lethality, with viable mice exhibiting white spotting on their ventral surface. We believe that the G37S knock-in mouse provides an excellent animal model for studying RNASEH2-associated autoimmune diseases.","dc:creator":"Pokatayev V","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"RNase H2 catalytic core Aicardi-Goutières syndrome-related mutant invokes cGAS-STING innate immune-sensing pathway in mice."},"rdfs:label":"RNASEH2A G37S knock-in mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:dca1f8e4-e678-4c72-9698-6e56381cfa7b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:40f51b32-d096-4ef4-ac30-c7c7c9cbf6c6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:40f51b32-d096-4ef4-ac30-c7c7c9cbf6c6","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:9adcb977-5a42-459a-97d9-3dae480691ea","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006397.3(RNASEH2A):c.690C>A (p.Phe230Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA345497"}},{"id":"cggv:f76cd6c8-d3b6-48d5-94b6-58c0125ad323","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006397.3(RNASEH2A):c.322C>T (p.Arg108Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA345495"}}],"detectionMethod":"NGS panel included 8 genes previously associated with type 1 interferonopathy.

Firstly, the c.69G>A (p.Val23Val) mutation causes the formation of a splice donor site within exon 1, resulting in an out of frame deletion at the end of exon 1, leading to reduced RNase H2 protein levels.

The truncated protein still forms a heterotrimeric RNase H2 complex, but lacks catalytic activity.

The aberrant transcript had a 54-bp in-frame deletion, resulting in an 18-amino acid internal deletion (del26-43) in the RNASEH2A protein. Coexpression of the mutant RNASEH2A with the B and C subunits in E. coli showed that although a mutant trimeric complex was formed, it exhibited no detectable catalytic activity, consistent with the loss of key metal-binding residues asp34 and glu35 in the mutant enzyme.

RNASEH2A encodes the ribonuclease H2 subunit A, which comprises 299 amino acids. RNASEH enzymes endolytically cleave ribonucleotides from RNA:DNA duplexes, which occur during DNA replication, transcription and translation. RNASEH2 has been proposed to function in the removal of lagging strand Okazaki fragment RNA primers during DNA replication, as well as in the excision of single ribonucleotides from DNA:DNA duplexes (PMIDs: 21177854, 16845400). \n\nThe described autosomal recessive RNASEH2A phenotype is considered to be a form of type 1 interferonopathy, which is defined as a condition in which increased type 1 interferon signaling leads to autoimmune and neurological disorders (MONDO: 0700259). These disorders are caused by variants in genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism, sensing, and the innate immune response. Individuals with biallelic variants in RNASEH2A can present with a range of symptoms of variable severity and age of onset, within the context of an autoimmune disease.\n\nAt least eight unique variants (missense, splicing, nonsense) have been reported across 10 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 29239743, 23592335, 16845400, 24183309) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is thought to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (model system studies, PMID: 26880576). A study by Pokatayev et al., 2016 showed that Rnaseh2aG37S/G37S knock-in mice demonstrate increased expression of IFN-stimulated genes and subsequent immune system activation. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between RNASEH2A and autosomal recessive RNASEH2A-related type 1 interferonopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic setting, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approached by the ClinGen Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy GCEP on the meeting date July 10, 2024 (SOP Version 10). \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:dca1f8e4-e678-4c72-9698-6e56381cfa7b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
