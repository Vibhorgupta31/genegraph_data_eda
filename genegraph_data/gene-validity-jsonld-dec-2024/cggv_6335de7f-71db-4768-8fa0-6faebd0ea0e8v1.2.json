Several studies have used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with DCM. In this study, we aimed to profile gene expression signatures and identify novel genes associated with DCM through a quantitative meta-analysis of three publicly available RNA-seq studies using human left ventricle tissues from 41 DCM cases and 21 control samples. Our meta-analysis identified 789 DEGs including 581 downregulated and 208 upregulated genes. Several DCM-related genes previously reported, including MYH6, CKM, NKX2-5 and ATP2A2, were among the top 50 DEGs. Our meta-analysis also identified 39 new DEGs that were not detected using those individual RNA-seq datasets. Some of those genes, including PTH1R, ADAM15 and S100A4, confirmed previous reports of associations with cardiovascular functions. Using DEGs from this meta-analysis, the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified five activated toxicity pathways, including failure of heart as the most significant pathway. Among the upstream regulators, SMARCA4 was downregulated and prioritized by IPA as the top affected upstream regulator for several DCM-related genes. To our knowledge, this study is the first to perform a transcriptomic meta-analysis for clinical DCM using RNA-seq datasets. Overall, our meta-analysis successfully identified a core set of genes associated with DCM.","dc:creator":"Alimadadi A","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Meta-Analysis of Dilated Cardiomyopathy Using Cardiac RNA-Seq Transcriptomic Datasets."},"rdfs:label":"RNA-seq meta-analysis of 41 DCM vs 21 controls"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:6335de7f-71db-4768-8fa0-6faebd0ea0e8_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7803f646-0b97-4cac-ab4f-5496f8ed8e3b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9f0d4941-b1c2-4f58-b769-61e62f94a1d6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Overexpression of the NKX2-5 allele with p.I183P in mice results in progressive cardiac conduction disease and heart failure, with severe ventricular dilatation, mirroring the dilated cardiomyopathy observed in human.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11457872","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"A DNA nonbinding mutant of the NK2 class homeoprotein Nkx2.5 dominantly inhibits cardiogenesis in Xenopus embryos, causing a small heart to develop or blocking heart formation entirely.

All four missense mutations identified in the human homeodomain led to markedly reduced DNA binding. To examine the effect of a DNA binding-impaired mutant of mouse Csx/Nkx2.5 in the embryonic heart, we generated transgenic mice expressing one such allele, I183P, under the beta-myosin heavy chain promoter. Unexpectedly, transgenic mice were born apparently normal, but the accumulation of Csx/Nkx2.5(I183P) mutant protein in the embryo, neonate, and adult myocardium resulted in progressive and profound cardiac conduction defects and heart failure. P-R prolongation observed at 2 weeks of age rapidly progressed into complete AV block as early as 4 weeks of age.

Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. At least 3 variants (all missense) have been reported in humans with DCM (Costa et al., 2013, PMID: 23661673, Hanley et al., 2016, PMID: 27855642 and Sveinbjornsson et al., 2018, PMID: 30354339).
