In both conditions rhodopsin re- generation is substantially delayed and both appear to be stationary (non-progressive). Fundus albipunctatus has been associated with mutations in the gene encoding the visual cycle enzyme RDH5 (11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase, Figure 1) (Yamamoto et al., 1999; Gonzalez- Fernandez et al., 1999). Because CRALBP increases the rate of oxidation of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal by RDH5 in vitro (Saari et al., 1994), it was possible that the Rlbp1-/- phenotype resulted from a primary impairment of the RDH5 reaction. However, the resulting 11- cis-retinol would be esterified and would accumulate as 11-cis-retinyl ester, as is observed in the RDH5 knockout mouse (Driessen et al., 2000). Notably, the retinyl ester that accumulated in Rlbp1-/- mice retinas contained little 11-cis-isomer and 11-cis-retinol did not accumulate, supporting a primary defect upstream of the oxidation reaction.\"","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11301032","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in the human CRALBP gene cause retinal pathology and delayed dark adaptation.

No evidence of photoreceptor degeneration was observed in animals raised in cyclic light/dark conditions for up to 1 year.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference/ in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the disease entities have been lumped under RLBP1-related retinopathy. \n\nAt least 8 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift etc.) have been reported in probands. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.  \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models and expression studies. In summary, RLBP1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive RLBP1-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Expert Panel on 6/3/2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d8c69db5-8d29-40af-85f0-59471ce0c62c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
