Recently, mutations in barttin, a protein not related to any known ion transporter or channel, were described in BSND, a variant of Bartter syndrome associated with sensorineural deafness. Here we show that barttin functions as an activator of ClC-K chloride channels. Expression of barttin together with ClC-K in Xenopus oocytes increased ClC-K current amplitude, changed ClC-K biophysical properties, and enhanced ClC-K abundance in the cell membrane. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed a direct interaction of barttin with ClC-K. We performed in situ hybridization on rat kidney slices and RT-PCR analysis on microdissected nephron segments to prove co-expression of barttin, ClC-K1 and ClC-K2 along the distal nephron. Functional analysis of BSND-associated point mutations revealed impaired ClC-K activation by barttin.

Barttin modulates the stability, cell surface localization, and function of ClC-K channels; distinct mutations cause phenotypes of varying severity. For definition of the molecular basis of this diversity, the functional consequences of six disease-causing mutations (R8L, R8W, G10S, Q32X, G47R, and E88X) on ClC-K channel properties were studied by heterologous expression in renal cell lines, electrophysiology, confocal imaging, and biochemical analysis. Three missense mutations (R8L, R8W, and G10S) eliminated the function of ClC-K/barttin channels but did not prevent the insertion of the channels into the surface membrane. Another mutant that produces a mild renal phenotype (G47R) was capable of performing all functions of wild-type barttin but bound to ClC-K channels less effectively. The nonsense mutation E88X affected epithelial sorting, leading to equal amounts of barttin inserting into the basolateral and apical membranes, contrasting with the preferential apical insertion of wild-type barttin. Last, the nonsense mutation Q32X allowed barttin to associate with ClC-K channels but prevented surface membrane insertion and channel activation. These results demonstrate that Bartter syndrome type IV can be caused by various derangements in the function of barttin, likely contributing to the diversity of observed phenotypes.","dc:creator":"Janssen AG","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Disease-causing dysfunctions of barttin in Bartter syndrome type IV."},"rdfs:label":"Janssen Non-Patient Cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This study received additional points for its thorough study of variant effects on protein function."},{"id":"cggv:a24b378f-92cc-4735-bcf0-ca4345182f78","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:369f30fe-6d4f-4e54-ab7e-b83036d63ccc","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"All truncating variants showed a significant decrease in cell conductance when compared to the WT.

This association was made using case-level data only). At least ‚Äã8 missense, start loss, deletion, and frameshift variants have been reported in humans. BSND‚Äã was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2001‚Äã (Birkenhager et al.‚Äã). Association is seen in at least 10 probands in 4 publications (11687798, ‚Äã12574213, 23110775, 16583241). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss. Expert review determined there was not enough convincing evidence to split out this disease. This gene-disease association is supported by functional studies that exhibit the molecular basis for disease of these variants (Birkenhager et al. 2001, Waldegger et al. 2002, Janssen et al. 2009) . A BSND mouse models have also been created that exhibit the hearing loss phenotypes seen in Bartter syndrome (Rickheit et al. 2008). In summary, BSND is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Bartter syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss‚Äã Working Group on 7/10/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9b69acb1-93bc-4bc0-8a33-77bf64179c32"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
