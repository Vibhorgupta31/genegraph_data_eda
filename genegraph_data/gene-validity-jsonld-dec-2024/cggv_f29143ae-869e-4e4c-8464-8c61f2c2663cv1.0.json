Multiple causative PCD mutations account for only 65% of cases, suggesting that many genes essential for cilia function remain to be discovered. By using zebrafish morpholino knockdown of PCD candidate genes as an in vivo screening platform, we identified c21orf59, ccdc65, and c15orf26 as critical for cilia motility. c21orf59 and c15orf26 knockdown in zebrafish and planaria blocked outer dynein arm assembly, and ccdc65 knockdown altered cilia beat pattern. Biochemical analysis in Chlamydomonas revealed that the C21orf59 ortholog FBB18 is a flagellar matrix protein that accumulates specifically when cilia motility is impaired. The Chlamydomonas ida6 mutant identifies CCDC65/FAP250 as an essential component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex. Analysis of 295 individuals with PCD identified recessive truncating mutations of C21orf59 in four families and CCDC65 in two families. Similar to findings in zebrafish and planaria, mutations in C21orf59 caused loss of both outer and inner dynein arm components. Our results characterize two genes associated with PCD-causing mutations and elucidate two distinct mechanisms critical for motile cilia function: dynein arm assembly for C21orf59 and assembly of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex for CCDC65.","dc:creator":"Austin-Tse C","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Zebrafish Ciliopathy Screen Plus Human Mutational Analysis Identifies C21orf59 and CCDC65 Defects as Causing Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia."}},{"id":"cggv:e8501023-5a79-48f8-bb22-6786fff8b5b7_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:10c4ec00-cb31-4e3e-a4e5-184c0f08ef34"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24094744"}],"rdfs:label":"Austin_P2"},{"id":"cggv:e8501023-5a79-48f8-bb22-6786fff8b5b7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e8501023-5a79-48f8-bb22-6786fff8b5b7_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e8501023-5a79-48f8-bb22-6786fff8b5b7_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"yes"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"only 19 PCD genes were screened"},{"id":"cggv:b530f30d-3157-4c99-9fb0-93af2de983c2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b530f30d-3157-4c99-9fb0-93af2de983c2_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b530f30d-3157-4c99-9fb0-93af2de983c2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Coinjection of c21orf59 morpholino \nwith a full-length human C21orf59 mRNA\n or three C21orf59 missense alleles \nrescued the motility of KV cilia, whereas \ninjection of human C21orf59 mRNA \nbearing the c.792_795delTTTA \n(p.Tyr264∗) mutation failed to \nrescue cilia motility.\n"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"only 19 PCD genes were screened"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2e17206f-6dea-4427-bf6f-28afeef288aa_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2e17206f-6dea-4427-bf6f-28afeef288aa","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:729a115c-5363-4c1a-9bd6-79e6e6cd0044","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021254.4(CFAP298):c.735C>G (p.Tyr245Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA346951"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002837","obo:HP_0011108"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:0b573e17-ce4f-4b00-8969-5dfe2fd68af0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:729a115c-5363-4c1a-9bd6-79e6e6cd0044"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24094744"},"rdfs:label":"Austin_P1"},{"id":"cggv:0b573e17-ce4f-4b00-8969-5dfe2fd68af0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0b573e17-ce4f-4b00-8969-5dfe2fd68af0_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:0b573e17-ce4f-4b00-8969-5dfe2fd68af0_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"Yes, "}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"The variant is not predicted to trigger nonsense-mediated decay, but rather to C-terminally truncate the protein product by 15-16%.

Four unrelated individuals were reported with biallelic *CFAP298* truncating variants and a classical PCD phenotype with reduced nasal nitric oxide, recurrent chest infections and both outer and inner dynein arm defects. Situs inversus was detected in all 3 patients carrying the homozygous c.735C>G (p.Tyr245Ter) nonsense variant. Haplotype analysis of these patients indicated that this mutation is located within a shared haplotype and strongly suggested a founder effect, consistent with the high allele frequency of 0.001736 observed in among control individuals in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The fourth published patient was compound heterozygous for the truncating variants c.292C>T (p.Arg98Ter), and c.792_795delTTTA (p.Tyr264Ter). Injection of human C21orf59 mRNA bearing the c.792_795delTTTA (p.Tyr264Ter) mutation failed to rescue cilia motility in zebrafish (PMID: 24094744). This curation identified but did not score an additional published proband from a cohort with laterality defects, due to the absence of additional clinical details to evaluate the full phenotype (PMID: 34215651). This curation was also informed by the identification of an additional proband within a French PCD cohort with biallelic variants in *CFAP298* and a phenotype matching the published cases. The mechanism of disease appears to be biallelic loss-of-function in *CFAP298*, however, there is an urgent need for publication of additional cases to better understand the spectrum of disease-causing variants and clinical features.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence that the *C21orf59* transcript is strongly expressed in ciliated tissues of the zebrafish trunk, including the pronephric ducts and spinal canal (PMID: 24094744). Morpholino knockdown of the *C21orf59* gene in zebrafish resulted in loss of dynein arms and a strong ciliopathy phenotype, including those involving pronephric cysts, axis curvature, left-right asymmetry defects, and hydrocephalus. Moreover, *C21orf59* mRNA expression in ciliated tissues is eliminated by *Foxj1a* knockdown, indicating that *C21orf59* expression is controlled by this ciliogenic transcription factor. *C21orf59*/*Kurly* (*Kur*) was also required for proper cilia polarization needed for the movement of the ECF in the zebrafish kidney and the larval skin of *Xenopus laevis* (PMID: 26904945). Motility- impaired *Chlamydomonas* mutants showed increased abundance of C21orf59/FBB18 protein suggesting that it is induced or stabilized when cilia motility is impaired (PMID: 24094744).\n \nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of *CFAP298* with primary ciliary dyskinesia 26 (MONDO:0014211). While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship more definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
