Here we identify a new gene located at the inv locus. The encoded protein contains 15 consecutive repeats of an Ank/Swi6 motif at its amino terminus. Expression of the gene is the highest in the kidneys and liver among adult tissues, and is seen in presomite-stage embryos. Analysis of the transgenic genome and the structure of the candidate gene indicate that the candidate gene is the only gene that is disrupted in inv mutants.

In zebrafish, the structurally related switch molecule diversin ameliorates renal cysts caused by the depletion of inversin, implying that an inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling is required for normal renal development.

At least 15 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in 11 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 12872123, 19177160, 31706999). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in one Bedouin family with 10 segregations (Haider et al. 1998; PMID: 9792867). The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models and an expression study (PMIDs: 9744276, 26615802, 15852005). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between INVS and autosomal recessive nephronophthisis-INVS. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cystic and Ciliopathy Expert Panel on the meeting date 2/24/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6bdaee2a-144d-4bdf-a5c7-78001b991174"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
