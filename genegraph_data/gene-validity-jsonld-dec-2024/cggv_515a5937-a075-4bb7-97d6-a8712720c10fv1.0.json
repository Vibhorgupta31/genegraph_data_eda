Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a model ciliopathy characterized by progressive retinal degeneration, obesity, polydactyly, cognitive impairment, kidney anomalies and hypogonadism. Mutations in SDCCAG8(NPHP10) were described recently in patients with nephronophthisis and retinal degeneration (Senior-Loken syndrome; SLS). Given the phenotypic and genetic overlap between known ciliopathy genes, we hypothesized that mutations in SDCCAG8 might also contribute alleles to more severe, multisystemic ciliopathies. We performed genetic and phenotypic analyses of 2 independent BBS cohorts. Subsequent to mutation screening, we made a detailed phenotypic analysis of 5 families mutated for SDCCAG8 (3 homozygous and 2 compound heterozygous mutations) and conducted statistical analyses across both cohorts to examine possible phenotype-genotype correlations with mutations at this locus. All patients with mutations in SDCCAG8 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for BBS (retinal degeneration, obesity, cognitive defects, renal failure, hypogonadism). Interestingly, none of the patients with primary SDCCAG8 mutations had polydactyly, a frequent but not obligatory BBS feature. In contrast, the same patients displayed early-onset renal failure, obesity, as well as recurrent pulmonary and ENT infections. Comparison of the phenotypes of these families with our entire BBS cohort indicated that renal impairment and absent polydactyly correlated significantly with causal SDCCAG8 mutations. Thus, SDCCAG8 mutations are sufficient to cause BBS in 1-2% of our combined cohorts, and define this gene as the sixteenth BBS locus (BBS16). The absence of polydactyly and the concomitant, apparently fully penetrant association with early kidney failure represents the first significant genotype-phenotype correlation in BBS that potentially represents an indicator for phenotype-driven priority screening and informs specific patient management.","dc:creator":"Schaefer E","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Mutations in SDCCAG8/NPHP10 Cause Bardet-Biedl Syndrome and Are Associated with Penetrant Renal Disease and Absent Polydactyly."}},"rdfs:label":"II.30 "},{"id":"cggv:33715b6b-f3df-48dc-9843-0299dfd046fa","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:33715b6b-f3df-48dc-9843-0299dfd046fa_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downscored for homozygosity/consanguinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9772ab07-b8ab-4c3c-b10e-db84d856edb8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9772ab07-b8ab-4c3c-b10e-db84d856edb8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:a78dc3ce-3ed6-40f6-9b39-fedb7f44178c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006642.5(SDCCAG8):c.849_852del (p.Cys283Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA733839698"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:cf3c3223-5245-4015-9c57-e5ac463f1928_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a78dc3ce-3ed6-40f6-9b39-fedb7f44178c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31534065","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease that is characterized by primary ciliary dysfunction (ciliopathy) and progresses to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) during the second decade of life (juvenile and adolescent NPHP) or before the age of 3 years (infantile NPHP). Here we describe the case of an infant with NPHP who carries a homozygous mutation in SDCCAG8 (also called NPHP10 or BBS16) that encodes SDCCAG8 (serologically defined colon cancer antigen 8). SDCCAG8 is localized at the centrioles of both renal epithelial cells and retinal photoreceptor cells. A mutation in SDCCAG8 is also associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), characterized by NPHP, obesity, polydactyly, and rod-cone dystrophy. A 2-year-old boy was referred to our hospital due to kidney dysfunction of unknown etiology; the patient presented with delayed development and opsoclonus but did not exhibit the clinical characteristics of BBS. Histological findings such as dilatation of tubules and irregular thickness of tubular basement membrane confirmed the diagnosis of NPHP. Four months after referral, the patient's renal function was rapidly deteriorated, and emergency peritoneal dialysis was initiated. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed, showing that the patient carries a homozygous four-base-pair deletion in SDCCAG8 (c.849_852delTTTG, p.Cys283Ter). The patient's parents were also found to be heterozygous for this loss-of-function mutation. To the best of our knowledge, the present patient is the first case of biopsy-proven infantile NPHP with a homozygous SDCCAG8 mutation.

All patients had retinal dystrophy with morphologic changes of the retina. Visual acuity decreased from ~0.2 (decimal) at age 5 to blindness 0 at 50 years. Visual field examination could be performed in only half of the patients and showed a concentric constriction with remaining islands of function in the periphery. ERG recordings were mostly extinguished whereas VEP recordings were reduced in about half of the patients. The cohort of patients showed 51 different likely biallelic mutations—of which 11 are novel—in 12 different BBS-associated genes.

Further, mutations in Rpgrip1 and Nphp4 suppress the elaboration of the outer segment compartment of photoreceptor neurons by elusive mechanisms, the understanding of which has critical implications in uncovering the pathogenesis of syndromic retinal dystrophies.

However, several other phenotypic and mechanistic features of Sdccag8gt/gt mice remained unexplored. Here we show that Sdccag8gt/gt mice exhibit developmental and structural abnormalities of the skeleton and limbs, suggesting impaired Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Indeed, cell culture studies demonstrate the requirement of SDCCAG8 for ciliogenesis and Hh signaling. Using an affinity proteomics approach, we demonstrate that SDCCAG8 interacts with proteins of the centriolar satellites (OFD1, AZI1), of the endosomal sorting complex (RABEP2, ERC1), and with non-muscle myosin motor proteins (MYH9, MYH10, MYH14) at the centrosome. Furthermore, we show that RABEP2 localization at the centrosome is regulated by SDCCAG8. siRNA mediated RABEP2 knockdown in hTERT-RPE1 cells leads to defective ciliogenesis, indicating a critical role for RABEP2 in this process. Together, this study identifies several centrosome-associated proteins as novel SDCCAG8 interaction partners, and provides new insights into the function of SDCCAG8 at this structure.","dc:creator":"Airik R","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"SDCCAG8 Interacts with RAB Effector Proteins RABEP2 and ERC1 and Is Required for Hedgehog Signaling."},"rdfs:label":"Sdccag8 is required or cilia formation and Hh signaling."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4bc63ffc-bea6-4ebf-874b-4a1c3887e779","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:08aa4a5f-9d14-4811-8641-5ad96db49ddf","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Sdccag8-C is required for localization to the basal bodies","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35131266","rdfs:label":"c-term is needed for centrosome localization in mouse cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:515a5937-a075-4bb7-97d6-a8712720c10f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d8c47288-e6cd-4828-a341-a2e4f0170847","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b730d108-5a1f-4cda-9daf-5bf8cd682bf6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"same phenotype","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35503560","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in serologically defined colon cancer autoantigen protein 8 ( ","dc:creator":"Ren ZL","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Characterization of two novel knock-in mouse models of syndromic retinal ciliopathy carrying hypomorphic "},"rdfs:label":"CRISPR knock in homozygous truncating- Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9115,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":14.2,"subject":{"id":"cggv:34252ff6-7e22-42d5-865b-1455e4f2e223","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014444","gene":"hgnc:10671","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"General Description:\nThe SDCCAG8 gene (also known as NPHP10), which encodes a centromeric structural protein (PMID 12559564), was first reported in relation to retinal disease in 2010, in which 12 truncating variants were described in affected individuals with nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies  (Otto et al., 2010. PMID 20835237); initial cloning and characterization of the gene occurred in murine tissues in 2003 (murine CCCAP, Kenedy et al., 2003. PMID 12559564). Missense variants in the SDCCAG8 gene  were then found in multiple families diagnosed with either Senior-Loken syndrome or Bardet-Biedl syndrome (PMIDs 20835237 and 22190896). SDCCAG8-related ciliopathy is characterized by a broad spectrum of symptoms, including retinal degeneration and nephronophthisis or kidney failure, with or without hypogonadism, respiratory complications and cognitive impairment. To date, studies suggest that, unlike other ciliopathies, SDCCAG8-related ciliopathy notably does not include  polydactyly (PMIDs 22626039, 22190896). \nSDCCAG8-related disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, with homozygous and compound heterozygous cases described in the literature. Because all cases with different diagnoses exhibit a dominant mode of inheritance and share overlapping phenotypes consistent with a single spectrum of disease, and consistent with criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, these cases have been lumped into a single disease entity, SDCCAG8-related retinopathy.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (9.2 points):\n5 suspected disease-causing variants (4 truncating variants and 1 intronic variant) reported in 4 probands from different countries in 4 publications (PMIDs: 22190896, 20835237, 31534065, 22190896) were scored in this curation. Notably, to date, disease-causing missense variants have not been reported in the literature. All reported variants are deletions, nonsense or splicing variants (for splicing example, see PMID: 22190896). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nMechanism for Disease:\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function, as multiple nonsense and splicing variants to be disease causing (PMID: 33910785, 24888636) and are characterized in the literature. A single intronic variant has also been reported to be disease causing (ClinVar ID: 60). However, some studies have suggested that missense variants might contribute to oligogenic inheritance of Mendelian ciliopathies (PMID 374231782, 35835773). \n\nExperimental Evidence: 5 POINTS\nThe SDCCAG8 gene product has been extensively studied in murine and cell culture models (PMID 35131266, 35503560). Consistent with a critical role in ciliary formation health, SDCCAG8 is expressed in photoreceptors (PMID 24722439) and is essential for photoreceptor development (PMID 38049871). Multiple cell culture models support the role of SDCCAG8 in cellular ciliary structures, as SDCCAG8 localizes to ciliary structures in vitro (PMIDs 24722439, 27224062).\n\nSummary Statement:\nIn summary, SDCCAG8  is definitively associated with retinal dystrophy; pathogenic variants are associated with autosomal recessive ciliopathy, manifesting in syndromic retinal dystrophy, kidney disease and other variable ciliary phenotypes. The association loss of function variants in SDCCAG8 has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\n\nUpheld over time.
