The severe form of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus can be associated with pancreas agenesis. Normal pancreas development is controlled by a cascade of transcription factors, where insulin promoter factor 1 (IPF1) plays a crucial role. Here, we describe two novel mutations in the IPF1 gene leading to pancreas agenesis. Direct sequence analysis of exons 1 and 2 of the IPF1 gene revealed two point mutations within the homeobox in exon 2. Genetic analysis of the parents showed that each mutation was inherited from one parent. Mutations localized in helices 1 and 2, respectively, of the homeodomain, decreased the protein half-life significantly, leading to intracellular IPF1 levels of 36% and 27% of wild-type levels. Both mutant forms of IPF1 were normally translocated to the nucleus, and their DNA binding activity on different known target promoters was similar to that of the wild-type protein. However, transcriptional activity of both mutant IPF1 proteins, alone or in combination with HNF3 beta/Foxa2, Pbx1, or the heterodimer E47-beta 2 was reduced, findings accounted for by decreased IPF1 steady state levels and not by impaired protein-protein interactions. We conclude that the IPF1 level is critical for human pancreas formation.","dc:creator":"Schwitzgebel VM","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Agenesis of human pancreas due to decreased half-life of insulin promoter factor 1."}},{"id":"cggv:5c46e586-b06b-4a00-8d50-142aae42f2fa_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d47cf19b-2a2e-4090-bb70-b2925822e146"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12970316"}],"rdfs:label":"Schwitzgebel proband"},{"id":"cggv:0f20fddb-338f-4ea7-a45e-5b13dfbf73d4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0f20fddb-338f-4ea7-a45e-5b13dfbf73d4_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:0f20fddb-338f-4ea7-a45e-5b13dfbf73d4_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Both variants shown to impair induction of luciferase compared to WT, suggesting impaired transcriptional activity; both mutant proteins were expressed at lower levels compared to WT; neither variant resulted in impaired nuclear localization "}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Variant absent from gnomAD; Both variants shown to impair induction of luciferase compared to WT, suggesting impaired transcriptional activity; both mutant proteins were expressed at lower levels compared to WT; neither variant resulted in impaired nuclear localization "},{"id":"cggv:5c46e586-b06b-4a00-8d50-142aae42f2fa","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5c46e586-b06b-4a00-8d50-142aae42f2fa_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:5c46e586-b06b-4a00-8d50-142aae42f2fa_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Both variants shown to impair induction of luciferase compared to WT, suggesting impaired transcriptional activity; both mutant proteins were expressed at lower levels compared to WT; neither variant resulted in impaired nuclear localization "}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Variant absent from gnomAD; Both variants shown to impair induction of luciferase compared to WT, suggesting impaired transcriptional activity; both mutant proteins were expressed at lower levels compared to WT; neither variant resulted in impaired nuclear localization "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:76ea8c1e-88ba-436a-8eca-0de131027033_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":8},{"id":"cggv:e13cf3db-f099-4c62-817b-0ac74536b7ce_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e13cf3db-f099-4c62-817b-0ac74536b7ce","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":0,"allele":{"id":"cggv:ab4812c5-b3af-438b-acf7-a0fe097162f1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000209.4(PDX1):c.188del (p.Pro63fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA341648"}},"detectionMethod":" not described - diagnostic genetic testing for PNDM performed by Athena Diagnostics","phenotypeFreeText":"birth weight = 1.56kg, born at 36wks after pregnancy complicated with gestational diabetes (treated with insulin), born via c-section, APGAR scores = 8 at 1, 9, and 5 min, initial blood glucose = 110mg/dL, 24hr blood glucose = 378mg/dL, sepsis evaluation negative, treated with IV insulin drip, urine ketones negative, GAD-65 and insulin autoantibodies were negative, C-peptide <0.5 ng/mL, insulin <2 Î¼U/mL, persistent weight loss w/in 3 weeks of birth, reducing substances present in stool, treated with pancreatic enzymes, 2mo HbA1c = 7.2%, 3mo HbA1c = 9%, 4mo HbA1c = 12.1%, 7mo HbA1c = 9%, ultrasound showed only mid and distal body of pancreas with no focal mass","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001824","obo:HP_0003074","obo:HP_0040214","obo:HP_0001562","obo:HP_0001511","obo:HP_0030795","obo:HP_0001738"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"microsatellite analysis of chromosome 6 for uniparental inheritance was normal; normal sequences in KCNJ11 and GCK","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:55dc13ee-91ce-45d7-86df-4e1803e6e949_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ab4812c5-b3af-438b-acf7-a0fe097162f1"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19496967","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus is a rare disorder known to be caused by activating mutations in KCNJ11 or ABCC8, inactivating mutations in INS, or very rarely in GCK or insulin promotor factor-1 (IPF-1) genes.

Targeted disruption of the Ipf1 gene encoding IPF1 in transgenic mice results in a failure of the pancreas to develop (pancreatic agenesis). Here, we report the identification of a single nucleotide deletion within codon 63 of the human IPF1 gene (13q12.1) in a patient with pancreatic agenesis. The patient is homozygous for the point deletion, whereas both parents are heterozygotes for the same mutation. The deletion was not found in 184 chromosomes from normal individuals, indicating that the mutation is unlikely to be a rare polymorphism. The point deletion causes a frame shift at the C-terminal border of the transactivation domain of IPF1 resulting in the translation of 59 novel codons before termination, aminoproximal to the homeodomain essential for DNA binding. Expression of mutant IPF1 in Cos-1 cells confirms the expression of a prematurely terminated truncated protein of 16 kD. Thus, the affected patient should have no functional IPF1 protein. Given the essential role of IPF1 in pancreas development, it is likely that this autosomal recessive mutation is the cause of the pancreatic agenesis phenotype in this patient. Thus, IPF1 appears to be a critical regulator of pancreas development in humans as well as mice.","dc:creator":"Stoffers DA","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Pancreatic agenesis attributable to a single nucleotide deletion in the human IPF1 gene coding sequence."}},"rdfs:label":"Stoffers proband"},{"id":"cggv:8b9d4a87-301c-4bcb-9d1d-0b66edf08ab3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8b9d4a87-301c-4bcb-9d1d-0b66edf08ab3_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:8b9d4a87-301c-4bcb-9d1d-0b66edf08ab3_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"expression plasmids carrying variant were transfected into COS1 cells.

(1988). Development 105, 787-794). To test this hypothesis directly, gene targeting was used to make two different null mutations in the mouse XlHbox8 homolog, pdx-1. In the first, the second pdx-1 exon, including the homeobox, was replaced by a neomycin resistance cassette. In the second, a lacZ reporter was fused in-frame with the N terminus of PDX-1, replacing most of the homeodomain. Neonatal pdx-1 -/- mice are apancreatic, in confirmation of previous reports (Jonsson, J., Carlsson, L., Edlund, T. and Edlund, H. (1994). Nature 371, 606-609). However, the pancreatic buds do form in homozygous mutants, and the dorsal bud undergoes limited proliferation and outgrowth to form a small, irregularly branched, ductular tree. This outgrowth does not contain insulin or amylase-positive cells, but glucagon-expressing cells are found. The rostral duodenum shows a local absence of the normal columnar epithelial lining, villi, and Brunner's glands, which are replaced by a GLUT2-positive cuboidal epithelium resembling the bile duct lining. Just distal of the abnormal epithelium, the numbers of enteroendocrine cells in the villi are greatly reduced. The PDX-1/beta-galactosidase fusion allele is expressed in pancreatic and duodenal cells in the absence of functional PDX-1, with expression continuing into perinatal stages with similar boundaries and expression levels. These results offer additional insight into the role of pdx-1 in the determination and differentiation of the posterior foregut, particularly regarding the proliferation and differentiation of the pancreatic progenitors.","dc:creator":"Offield MF","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"PDX-1 is required for pancreatic outgrowth and differentiation of the rostral duodenum."},"rdfs:label":"Offield Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"neonatal pdx1 -/- mice were apancreatic, but pancreatic buds were present with the dorsal bud having limited differentiation, there was also absence of insulin- and amylase-positive cells, glucagon-expressing cells were detected"},{"id":"cggv:cac9026e-1bcc-49b2-9d3a-c8019e003679","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d46e5c25-d536-48ae-826c-b91c5a38cb44","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Mice homozygous for IPF1 mutation had pancreatic agenesis; pups died within few days of birth; all other GI and internal organs had normal development; complete absence of pancreatic tissue and ectopic expression of insulin and pancreatic amylase","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7935793","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The mammalian pancreas is a mixed exocrine and endocrine gland that, in most species, arises from ventral and dorsal buds which subsequently merge to form the pancreas. In both mouse and rat the first histological sign of morphogenesis of the dorsal pancreas is a dorsal evagination of the duodenum at the level of the liver at around the 22-25-somite stage, and shortly thereafter a ventral evagination appears as a derivative of the liver diverticulum. Low levels of insulin gene transcripts are already present and restricted to the dorsal foregut endoderm at 20 somites, suggesting that pancreas- or insulin gene-specific transcriptional factors are present in this region before the onset of morphogenesis. Insulin-promoter-factor 1 (IPF1) is a homeodomain protein which, in the adult mouse pancreas, is selectively expressed in the beta-cells and binds to and transactivates the insulin promoter. In mouse embryos, IPF1 expression is restricted to the developing pancreatic anlagen and is initiated when the foregut endoderm is committed to a pancreatic fate. We now show that mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in the Ipf1 gene selectively lack a pancreas. The mutant pups survive fetal development but die within a few days after birth. The gastrointestinal part and all other internal organs were normal in appearance. No pancreatic tissue and no ectopic expression of insulin or pancreatic amylase could be detected in mutant embryos and neonates. These findings show that IPF1 is needed for the formation of the pancreas and suggest that it acts to determine the fate of common pancreatic precursor cells and/or to regulate their propagation.","dc:creator":"Jonsson J","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Insulin-promoter-factor 1 is required for pancreas development in mice."},"rdfs:label":"Jonsson et al. mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Mice homozygous for IPF1 mutation had pancreatic agenesis; pups died within few days of birth; all other GI and internal organs had normal development; complete absence of pancreatic tissue and ectopic expression of insulin and pancreatic amylase"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4577,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":13,"subject":{"id":"cggv:7c57a380-8294-4580-ab6c-f501890e98d4","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0024547","gene":"hgnc:6107","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*PDX1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive pancreatic agenesis with neonatal diabetes mellitus in 1997 (Stoffers et al., PMID: 8988180).  Five variants (missense and frameshift) that have been reported in 4 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 8988180, 12970316, 19496967, 20009086) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF through a variety of mechanisms.  One variant, c.188del/p.Pro63fs, reported in the homozygous state in at least two patients with neonatal diabetes and pancreatic agenesis (PMIDs:  8988180, 19496967), was shown to create two isoforms, one which is transcriptionally inactive and one which localizes to the nucleus and binds DNA but lacks a transactivation domain (PMID: 9649577).  Two missense variants reported in the compound heterozygous state in a patient with diabetes and pancreatic agenesis were shown to reduce levels of the IPF-1 protein encoded by *PDX1* (PMID: 12970316).  Two cousins with neonatal diabetes without pancreatic agenesis but found to have subclinical evidence of exocrine pancreatic deficiency were homozygous for a missense variant found to reduce *PDX1* transactivation (PMID:  20009086).  Overall case-level evidence:  8 points.  This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 15756539, 23715323, 7935793, 8631275). An in vitro functional assay supported the role of *PDX1* disruption in impaired proinsulin processing and insulin secretion (PMID: 15756539). *PDX1* expression has been confirmed in the pancreas via eQTL analysis (PMID: 23715323). Evidence from 2 mouse models has supported the role of *PDX1* disruption in pancreatic agenesis (PMIDs: 7935793, 8631275).  Overall experimental evidence 5 points.  Overall genetic and experimental evidence 13 points.\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes (OMIM:606391) and autosomal recessive pancreatic agenesis 1 with neonatal diabetes (OMIM: 260370). The split curation for autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes has been curated separately.\n\nIn summary, *PDX1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive pancreatic agenesis or pancreatic exocrine dysfunction with neonatal diabetes mellitus, particularly through the c.188del variant, which effectively leads to complete loss of function in homozygotes. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:76ea8c1e-88ba-436a-8eca-0de131027033"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
