It is estimated that at least 30% to 40% of individuals remain without a precise diagnosis despite extensive investigations. We mapped tremor-ataxia with central hypomyelination (TACH) to 10q22.3-23.1 in French-Canadian families and sequenced candidate genes within this interval. Two missense and one insertion mutations in five individuals with TACH were uncovered in POLR3A, which codes for the largest subunit of RNA polymerase III (Pol III). Because these families were mapped to the same locus as leukodystrophy with oligodontia (LO) and presented clinical and radiological overlap with individuals with hypomyelination, hypodontia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4H) syndrome, we sequenced this gene in nine individuals with 4H and eight with LO. In total, 14 recessive mutations were found in 19 individuals with TACH, 4H, or LO, establishing that these leukodystrophies are allelic. No individual was found to carry two nonsense mutations. Immunoblots on 4H fibroblasts and on the autopsied brain of an individual diagnosed with 4H documented a significant decrease in POLR3A levels, and there was a more significant decrease in the cerebral white matter compared to that in the cortex. Pol III has a wide set of target RNA transcripts, including all nuclear-coded tRNA. We hypothesize that the decrease in POLR3A leads to dysregulation of the expression of certain Pol III targets and thereby perturbs cytoplasmic protein synthesis. This type of broad alteration in protein synthesis is predicted to occur in other leukoencephalopathies such as hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-3, caused by mutations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1 (AIMP1).","dc:creator":"Bernard G","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Mutations of POLR3A encoding a catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase Pol III cause a recessive hypomyelinating leukodystrophy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ae31bb4b-43af-4516-9f23-af2fd40a732d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d81d2dd8-362f-47ff-8a81-e0efb990e70f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d81d2dd8-362f-47ff-8a81-e0efb990e70f","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:321f0cca-dc9e-4182-8963-97710dc01ed7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_007055.4(POLR3A):c.1572+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5571420"}},{"id":"cggv:c7b8d02a-325a-46b2-b193-306cfb2de659","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_007055.4(POLR3A):c.3337-5T>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5570861"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"First tooth erupted at 2 yrs and then spontaneously lost, 2 teeth at age 3 yrs; dysmorphic features; decreased subcutaneous fat especially over extremities, thin extremities","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001511","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:196db6df-48ed-41fa-a44e-84bf9f2a85af_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:321f0cca-dc9e-4182-8963-97710dc01ed7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30414627","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome (WRS), also known as neonatal progeroid syndrome, is a rare disorder of unknown etiology. It has been proposed to be autosomal-recessive and is characterized by variable clinical features, such as intrauterine growth restriction and poor postnatal weight gain, characteristic facial features (triangular appearance to the face, convex nasal profile or pinched nose, and small mouth), widened fontanelles, pseudohydrocephalus, prominent scalp veins, lipodystrophy, and teeth abnormalities. A previous report described a single WRS patient with bi-allelic truncating and splicing variants in POLR3A. Here we present seven additional infants, children, and adults with WRS and bi-allelic truncating and/or splicing variants in POLR3A. POLR3A, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase III, is a DNA-directed RNA polymerase that transcribes many small noncoding RNAs that regulate transcription, RNA processing, and translation. Bi-allelic missense variants in POLR3A have been associated with phenotypes distinct from WRS: hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hypomyelinating leukodystrophy with or without oligodontia. Our findings confirm the association of bi-allelic POLR3A variants with WRS, expand the clinical phenotype of WRS, and suggest specific POLR3A genotypes associated with WRS and hypomyelinating leukodystrophy.","dc:creator":"Wambach JA","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Bi-allelic POLR3A Loss-of-Function Variants Cause Autosomal-Recessive Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch Syndrome."}},{"id":"cggv:6910d5d2-e3cc-4efb-8bf0-e09a722e9b52_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c7b8d02a-325a-46b2-b193-306cfb2de659"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30414627"}],"rdfs:label":"Wambach Subject 4"},{"id":"cggv:6910d5d2-e3cc-4efb-8bf0-e09a722e9b52","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6910d5d2-e3cc-4efb-8bf0-e09a722e9b52_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Recurrent variant, present in multiple non-related individuals"},{"id":"cggv:196db6df-48ed-41fa-a44e-84bf9f2a85af","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:196db6df-48ed-41fa-a44e-84bf9f2a85af_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2dc83bad-605f-4f6b-9d0f-1fbee808ac4d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2dc83bad-605f-4f6b-9d0f-1fbee808ac4d","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:75d0027e-255c-4c81-948e-532527459760","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_007055.4(POLR3A):c.490+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA377346347"}},{"id":"cggv:c7b8d02a-325a-46b2-b193-306cfb2de659"}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"dysmorphic features, decreased subcutaneous fat, localized fat distribution over posterior iliac region and buttocks, developmental delay","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001511","obo:HP_0000483","obo:HP_0000695"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:b3f1cf2d-5974-4ffc-97e5-f834d5031009_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:75d0027e-255c-4c81-948e-532527459760"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30414627"},{"id":"cggv:71aa3b23-4f9a-484f-aec2-418b31c1165a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c7b8d02a-325a-46b2-b193-306cfb2de659"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30414627"}],"rdfs:label":"Wambach Subject 1"},{"id":"cggv:b3f1cf2d-5974-4ffc-97e5-f834d5031009","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b3f1cf2d-5974-4ffc-97e5-f834d5031009_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:71aa3b23-4f9a-484f-aec2-418b31c1165a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:71aa3b23-4f9a-484f-aec2-418b31c1165a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Recurrent variant, present in multiple non-related individuals"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:031b2c28-f4db-4e02-8ba9-fb2a2ee2a625_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:031b2c28-f4db-4e02-8ba9-fb2a2ee2a625","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:fa60fda7-0079-4304-97be-2428f55a604b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_007055.4(POLR3A):c.2300G>T (p.Cys767Phe)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA377337109"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002415","obo:HP_0033784","obo:HP_0000044","obo:HP_0034332"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:db7f837a-a7c0-43a4-bfee-e3b2a06a2926_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:fa60fda7-0079-4304-97be-2428f55a604b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38561452","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (HLD) is a rare genetic heterogeneous disease that can affect myelin development in the central nervous system. This study aims to analyze the clinical phenotype and genetic function of a family with HLD-7 caused by POLR3A mutation. The proband (IV6) in this family mainly showed progressive cognitive decline, dentin dysplasia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Her three old brothers (IV1, IV2, and IV4) also had different degrees of ataxia, dystonia, or dysarthria besides the aforementioned manifestations. Their brain magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral periventricular white matter atrophy, brain atrophy, and corpus callosum atrophy and thinning. The proband and her two living brothers (IV2 and IV4) were detected to carry a homozygous mutation of the POLR3A (NM_007055.4) gene c. 2300G > T (p.Cys767Phe), and her consanguineous married parents (III1 and III2) were p.Cys767Phe heterozygous carriers. In the constructed POLR3A wild-type and p.Cys767Phe mutant cells, it was seen that overexpression of wild-type POLR3A protein significantly enhanced Pol III transcription of 5S rRNA and tRNA Leu-CAA. However, although the mutant POLR3A protein overexpression was increased compared to the wild-type protein overexpression, it did not show the expected further enhancement of Pol III function. On the contrary, Pol III transcription function was frustrated (POLR3A, BC200, and tRNA Leu-CAA expression decreased), and MBP and 18S rRNA expressions were decreased. This study indicates that the POLR3A p.Cys767Phe variant caused increased expression of mutated POLR3A protein and abnormal expression of Pol III transcripts, and the mutant POLR3A protein function was abnormal.","dc:creator":"Ruan DD","dc:date":"2024","dc:title":"Clinical phenotype and genetic function analysis of a family with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-7 caused by POLR3A mutation."}},"rdfs:label":"Ruan proband IV6"},{"id":"cggv:db7f837a-a7c0-43a4-bfee-e3b2a06a2926","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:db7f837a-a7c0-43a4-bfee-e3b2a06a2926_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:db7f837a-a7c0-43a4-bfee-e3b2a06a2926_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"We observed that both tRNA-Leu-CAA and 18S rRNA levels were decreased after the POLR3A p.Cys767Phe mutation compared to the wild type.

Variants were then described in association with Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome (WRS) (PMID: 30414627) in 2018. Per criteria outlined by the Clingen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) or inheritance pattern; and found that the spectrum of phenotypic variability could exist between the described disease entities. Therefore, the prior disease entities have been lumped into one entity, POLR3A-Related Disorders (MONDO:0700276). Clinical characteristics include a variable age of onset with a spectrum of global developmental delay, failure to thrive, hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, neurological dysfunction, dental abnormalities, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\nPOLR3A is the largest subunit of RNA Polymerase III, which transcribes ribosomal, transfer, and nuclear RNAs (PMID: 34395528). \nIncluded in this curation are twelve unique variants found in nine subjects across four publications. Four of the twelve variants are predicted or proven null variants (canonical splice site variants or nonsense), the remainder are missense variants. Four of the variants had functional data supporting pathogenicity of the variant (PMID: 21855841, PMID: 30898877, PMID:38561452). Two variants had points upgraded due to variant recurrence across non-related affected patients. \nThe mechanism of function is loss-of-function. Gene-disease relationship is supported by mouse models with POLR3A mutations (PMID: 38168294, PMID: 34583988). The gene-disease pair has had replication over time showing convincing evidence. More evidence in the literature is present, but the maximum score required for genetic evidence has been reached (12 points).\nTo summarize, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between POLR3A and POLR3A-Related Disorders, with rigorous and reproducible evidence in clinical and research settings. This gene-disease curation based on ClinGen criteria was approved by the Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy GCEP on 8/28/2024 (SOP version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ae31bb4b-43af-4516-9f23-af2fd40a732d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
