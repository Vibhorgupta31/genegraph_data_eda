The present study conducted a focused analysis of potential candidate or susceptibility genes for common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes using multi-gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing. This study included patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, and epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone. We identified pathogenic variants according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines and identified susceptibility variants using case-control association analyses and family analyses for familial cases. A total of 57 patients were enrolled, including 51 sporadic cases and 6 familial cases. Twenty-two pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants of 16 different genes were identified. CACNA1H was the most frequently observed single gene. Variants of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel genes, including CACNA1A, CACNA1G, and CACNA1H were observed in 32% of variants (n = 7/22). Analyses to identify susceptibility variants using case-control association analysis indicated that KCNMA1 c.400G>C was associated with common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes. Only 1 family (family A) exhibited a candidate pathogenic variant p.(Arg788His) on CACNA1H, as determined via family analyses. This study identified candidate genetic variants in about a quarter of patients (n = 16/57) and an average of 2.8 variants was identified in each patient. The results reinforced the polygenic disorder with very high locus and allelic heterogeneity of common GGE syndromes. Further, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are suggested as important contributors to common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes. This study extends our comprehensive understanding of common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes.","dc:creator":"Lee CG","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Multi-gene panel testing in Korean patients with common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29924869","rdfs:label":"E-011"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Downgraded because of other potentially causative variants"},{"id":"cggv:546c551a-28ef-4488-a13d-0985719784eb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7c86a2e8-ee49-4e41-b43e-8f0d931facfe","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Panel of 70 candidate genes","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001250","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:546c551a-28ef-4488-a13d-0985719784eb_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:c5c1d671-0dd8-4562-aa92-999c2d0d6074","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_139058.3(ARX):c.1141G>A (p.Ala381Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA294628"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29655203","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We evaluated >8500 consecutive, unselected patients with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders who underwent multigene panel testing to determine the average age at molecular diagnosis and diagnostic yield of 70 genes.","dc:creator":"Lindy AS","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Diagnostic outcomes for genetic testing of 70 genes in 8565 patients with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29655203","rdfs:label":"Lindy_2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"not scored due to lack of phenotypic and zygosity information"},{"id":"cggv:e4d15cb8-09b9-40e3-84f6-0f61e1e2fe5f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:764ac0fd-c37f-439d-a5b0-7cdd6cfd31ae","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":11,"detectionMethod":"Chromosomal analysis, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), fragile X test- ing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001334","obo:HP_0007099","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001508","obo:HP_0007057","obo:HP_0008872"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:e4d15cb8-09b9-40e3-84f6-0f61e1e2fe5f_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:084ed6f7-2a0a-45ea-8620-9154e3e48150","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_139058.3(ARX):c.447G>C (p.Ala149=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10373900"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18462864","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We present four patients with ARX mutations and widely variant clinical presentations.

To date, only 10 males with CDKL5 mutations have been reported. Our retrospective study reports on the clinical, neuroimaging, and molecular findings of 18 males with early-onset epilepsy caused by either CDKL5 or ARX mutations.

In this study, we determined the diagnostic yield of a clinical gene panel applied to an unselected cohort of epilepsy patients.","dc:creator":"Butler KM","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Diagnostic Yield From 339 Epilepsy Patients Screened on a Clinical Gene Panel."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29056246","rdfs:label":"Case 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"not scored due to lack of phenotypic and zygosity information"},{"id":"cggv:c4a704b7-c5cf-4432-992d-8978bef9a1ef_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a525f316-cc02-4b7b-8d2c-915cd4022420","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Panel of 70 candidate genes sequenced with NGS","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001250","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:c4a704b7-c5cf-4432-992d-8978bef9a1ef_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:5c74d35d-bf16-4e43-a573-7af336953de3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_139058.3(ARX):c.306_308GGC[17] (p.Ala109_Ala115dup)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA213330"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29655203"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29655203","rdfs:label":"Lindy_9"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"not scored due to lack of phenotypic and zygosity information"},{"id":"cggv:474a7cf7-8f63-48b7-bbea-341bf4881e56_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:036f457b-0d03-4bb6-97cb-931e12a468e0","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":4,"detectionMethod":"exomes 1-5 sequenced","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"G-tube inserted for feeding after using ACTH to control seizures","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0007772","obo:HP_0002307","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0000369","obo:HP_0000286","obo:HP_0000126","obo:HP_0000473","obo:HP_0011170","obo:HP_0012469","obo:HP_0001357"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:474a7cf7-8f63-48b7-bbea-341bf4881e56_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:4078f00b-0f8f-40de-9dc4-d14931732e3e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_139058.3(ARX):c.1465del (p.Ala489ProfsTer3)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA213235"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18462864"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18462864","rdfs:label":"Case 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not scored because the proband could be a carrier.

We report the results found in a group of 87 patients with epilepsy and developmental delay using targeted next generation sequencing (custom-designed Haloplex panel). Using this gene panel, we were able to identify disease-causing variants in 17 out of 87 (19.5%) analyzed patients, all found in known epilepsy-associated genes (KCNQ2, CDKL5, STXBP1, SCN1A, PCDH19, POLG, SLC2A1, ARX, ALG13, CHD2, SYNGAP1, and GRIN1). Twelve of 18 variants arose de novo and 6 were novel. The highest yield was found in patients with onset in the first years of life, especially in patients classified as having early-onset epileptic encephalopathy.

Genetic mutations have been identified to contribute to an increasing number of children with early onset EE which had been previously considered as cryptogenic. We identified 26 patients with Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy (IEE) of unknown etiology despite extensive workup and without any specific epilepsy syndromic phenotypes. We performed genetic analysis on a panel of 7 genes (ARX, CDKL5, KCNQ2, PCDH19, SCN1A, SCN2A, STXBP1) and identified 10 point mutations [ARX (1), CDKL5 (3), KCNQ2 (2), PCDH19 (1), SCN1A (1), STXBP1 (2)] as well as one microdeletion involving both SCN1A and SCN2A. The high rate (42%) of mutations suggested that genetic testing of this IEE panel of genes is recommended for cryptogenic IEE with no etiology identified.

The generation of Arx-deficient mice revealed several morphological anomalies, resembling those observed in patients and an interneuron migration defect but perinatal lethality precluded analyses of later phenotypes. Interestingly, many of the neurological phenotypes observed in patients with various ARX mutations can be attributed, in part, to interneuron dysfunction. To directly test this possibility, mice carrying a floxed Arx allele were generated and crossed to Dlx5/6(CRE-IRES-GFP)(Dlx5/6(CIG)) mice, conditionally deleting Arx from ganglionic eminence derived neurons including cortical interneurons. We now report that Arx(-/y);Dlx5/6(CIG) (male) mice exhibit a variety of seizure types beginning in early-life, including seizures that behaviourally and electroencephalographically resembles infantile spasms, and show evolution through development. Thus, this represents a new genetic model of a malignant form of paediatric epilepsy, with some characteristics resembling infantile spasms, caused by mutations in a known infantile spasms gene. Unexpectedly, approximately half of the female mice carrying a single mutant Arx allele (Arx(-/+);Dlx5/6(CIG)) also developed seizures. We also found that a subset of human female carriers have seizures and neurocognitive deficits. In summary, we have identified a previously unrecognized patient population with neurological deficits attributed to ARX mutations that are recapitulated in our mouse model. Furthermore, we show that perturbation of interneuron subpopulations is an important mechanism underling the pathogenesis of developmental epilepsy in both hemizygous males and carrier females. Given the frequency of ARX mutations in patients with infantile spasms and related disorders, our data unveil a new model for further understanding the pathogenesis of these disorders.","dc:creator":"Marsh E","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Targeted loss of Arx results in a developmental epilepsy mouse model and recapitulates the human phenotype in heterozygous females."},"rdfs:label":"Interneuronal deficits"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not scored for lack of specific epilepsy phenotype."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:3a5357ce-2161-4a7f-a8e1-a1dba4550e57_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3543bf83-d645-40b2-804c-2fc625ce6e1d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c86f1255-7358-4799-8255-2f260140ac98","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The phenotypes exhibited in the mutant mice match those of patients with infantile spasms.

It is also reported in relation to intellectual disability (syndromic and nonsyndromic), hydranencephaly with abnormal genitalia, X-linked Lissencephaly, Partington syndrome, and Proud syndrome. Evidence included in this curation excluded individuals with syndromic diagnoses and/or intellectual disability.  At least 18 unique variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift and polyalanine repeat, etc.) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease pair includes case-level data and experimental data. In summary, ARX is definitively associated with X-linked Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 6/4/19 (SOP version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3a5357ce-2161-4a7f-a8e1-a1dba4550e57"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
