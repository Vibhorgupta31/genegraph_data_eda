The mouse Kcnq4 orthologue was previously localized to the outer hair cells (OHCs) of the inner ear, suggesting the pathophysiological effects were due to dysfunctional OHCs. Yet, OHC dysfunction does not provide a plausible explanation for the progressive nature of the frequency specific hearing loss. We have re-examined and extended the expression analyses of KCNQ4 in the murine inner ear using RT-PCR and whole mount in situ hybridization. Our results confirmed that the rat KCNQ4 orthologue is expressed in both inner and outer hair cells. Reciprocal longitudinal gradients were found in inner hair cells (IHCs) and OHCs. The strongest expression of KCNQ4 in IHCc was in the base of the cochlea and in the apex for OHCs. Similar to the IHCs, a basal to apical gradient was present in the spiral sensory neurons. IHCs mediate hearing via their afferent sensory neurons, whereas OHCs function as active cochlear amplifiers. The complete absence of OHCs leads only to severe sensitivity reduction, but not complete hearing loss. Our data suggest that the primary defect leading to initial high frequency loss and subsequent progressive hearing loss for all frequencies may be due to spiral ganglion and/or IHC dysfunction, rather than an OHC aberration.","dc:creator":"Beisel KW","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Longitudinal gradients of KCNQ4 expression in spiral ganglion and cochlear hair cells correlate with progressive hearing loss in DFNA2."},"rdfs:label":"Expressed in Rat inner ear"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:88196c6d-4bd7-4aff-ba98-c7b4411c562d_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a0f502dc-3b9c-4532-b1e2-08c9e98d33c9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cee02135-0b61-4e84-9a61-6b4805c5f225","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Provides explanation for genotype phenotype correlation between missense and truncating variants.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10025409","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Potassium channels regulate electrical signaling and the ionic composition of biological fluids.

Mutations in the KCNQ4 gene lead to DFNA2, a subtype of autosomal dominant non-syndromic deafness that is characterized by progressive sensorineural hearing loss across all frequencies. Despite recent advances in the identification of pathogenic KCNQ4 mutations, the molecular aetiology of DFNA2 remains unknown. We report here that decreased cell surface expression and impaired conductance of the KCNQ4 channel are two mechanisms underlying hearing loss in DFNA2. In HEK293T cells, a dramatic decrease in cell surface expression was detected by immunofluorescent microscopy and confirmed by Western blot for the pathogenic KCNQ4 mutants L274H, W276S, L281S, G285C, G285S, G296S and G321S, while their overall cellular levels remained normal. In addition, none of these mutations affected tetrameric assembly of KCNQ4 channels. Consistent with these results, all mutants showed strong dominant-negative effects on the wild-type (WT) channel function. Most importantly, overexpression of HSP90Î², a key component of the molecular chaperone network that controls the KCNQ4 biogenesis, significantly increased cell surface expression of the KCNQ4 mutants L281S, G296S and G321S. KCNQ4 surface expression was restored or considerably improved in HEK293T cells mimicking the heterozygous condition of these mutations in DFNA2 patients. Finally, our electrophysiological studies demonstrated that these mutations directly compromise the conductance of the KCNQ4 channel, since no significant change in KCNQ4 current was observed after KCNQ4 surface expression was restored or improved.

In addition, a review of the reported mutations was performed for better understanding of this deafness gene. The screening using 287 probands from unbiased Japanese autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL) families identified 19 families with 7 different disease causing mutations, indicating that the frequency is 6.62% (19/287). While the majority were private mutations, one particular recurrent mutation, c.211delC, was observed in 13 unrelated families. Haplotype analysis in the vicinity of c.211delC suggests existence of a common ancestor. The majority of the patients showed all frequency, but high-frequency predominant, sensorineural hearing loss. The present study adds a new typical audiogram configuration characterized by mid-frequency predominant hearing loss caused by the p.V230E mutation. A variant at the N-terminal site (c. 211delC) showed typical ski-slope type audiogram configuration. Concerning clinical features, onset age was from 3 to 40 years old, and mostly in the teens, and hearing loss was gradually progressive. Progressive nature is a common feature of patients with KCNQ4 mutations regardless of the mutation type. In conclusion, KCNQ4 mutations are frequent among ADNSHL patients, and therefore screening of the gene and molecular confirmation of these mutations have become important in the diagnosis of these conditions.","dc:creator":"Naito T","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Comprehensive genetic screening of KCNQ4 in a large autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss cohort: genotype-phenotype correlations and a founder mutation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23717403","rdfs:label":"Naito Japanese Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The p.H77fs variant is predicted to cause LOF"},{"id":"cggv:5ba87570-54a9-44b9-8a6d-6155092e653e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2c33fe9f-6c9b-47bc-9c3f-7018838c00c0","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":33,"detectionMethod":"","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:5ba87570-54a9-44b9-8a6d-6155092e653e_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:626228e7-686c-4191-a13a-0df2949d22d9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004700.3(KCNQ4):c.1044_1051delTGCCTGGC (p.Ala349Profs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/208372"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26036578","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutation of KCNQ4 has been reported to cause autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNA2A) that usually presents as progressive hearing loss starting from mild to moderate hearing loss during childhood. Here, we identified a novel KCNQ4 mutation, c.1044_1051del8, in a family with autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss. The proband was homozygous for the mutation and was born to consanguineous parents; she showed severe hearing loss that was either congenital or of early childhood onset. The proband had a sister who was heterozygous for the mutation but showed normal hearing. The mutation caused a frameshift that eliminated most of the cytoplasmic C-terminus, including the A-domain, which has an important role for protein tetramerization, and the B-segment, which is a binding site for calmodulin (CaM) that regulates channel function via Ca ions. The fact that the heterozygote had normal hearing indicates that sufficient tetramerization and CaM binding sites were present to preserve a normal phenotype even when only half the proteins contained an A-domain and B-segment. On the other hand, the severe hearing loss in the homozygote suggests that complete loss of the A-domain and B-segment in the protein caused loss of function due to the failure of tetramer formation and CaM binding. This family suggests that some KCNQ4 mutations can cause autosomal recessive hearing loss with more severe phenotype in addition to autosomal dominant hearing loss with milder phenotype. This genotype-phenotype correlation is analogous to that in KCNQ1 which causes autosomal dominant hereditary long QT syndrome 1 with milder phenotype and the autosomal recessive Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome 1 with more severe phenotype due to deletion of the cytoplasmic C-terminus of the potassium channel.

We encountered a large Japanese pedigree in which nonsyndromic hearing loss was inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. A genome-wide linkage study indicated linkage to the DFNA2 locus on chromosome 1p34. Mutational analysis of KCNQ4 encoding a potassium channel revealed a novel one-base deletion in exon 1, c.211delC, which generated a profoundly truncated protein without transmembrane domains (p.Q71fsX138). Previously, six missense mutations and one 13-base deletion, c.211_223del, had been reported in KCNQ4. Patients with the KCNQ4 missense mutations had younger-onset and more profound hearing loss than patients with the 211_223del mutation. In our current study, 12 individuals with the c.211delC mutation manifested late-onset and pure high-frequency hearing loss. Our results support the genotype-phenotype correlation that the KCNQ4 deletions are associated with later-onset and milder hearing impairment than the missense mutations.

KCNQ4 was first associated with this disease in humans in 1999 (Coucke et al.). More than enough genetic evidence is available in the literature to reach the maximum score (12 pts.). The hearing loss in patients is progressive and predominantly high-frequency, however the phenotypic spectrum may be variable. The mechanism for disease is either haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative, which is strongly supported by experimental evidence. This gene-disease association is also supported by multiple mouse models, expression evidence, and in vitro functional assays (PMID: 11042367, 24555524, 10025409, 23750663, 16437162). In summary, KCNQ4 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss.
