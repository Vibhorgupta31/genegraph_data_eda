Despite a lack of sequence homology, the genes are aligned in a head-to-tail configuration and joined by chromosomal rearrangement at the amphibian-to-reptile evolutionary transition. Expression of the two genes is mediated by a conserved regulatory element in the noncoding intergenic region.

Most cases display a broad spectrum of additional features, including polydactyly, retinal dystrophy and renal abnormalities, which define different subtypes of JS-related disorders (JSRDs). To date, 23 genes have been shown to cause JSRDs, and although most of the identified genes encode proteins involved in cilia function or assembly, the molecular mechanisms associated with ciliary signaling remain enigmatic. Arab populations are ethnically diverse with high levels of consanguinity (20-60%) and a high prevalence of AR disorders. In addition, isolated communities with very-high levels of inbreeding and founder mutations are common. In this article, we review the 70 families reported thus far with JS and JSRDs that have been studied at the molecular level from all the Arabic countries and compile the mutations found. We show that JS and the related JSRDs are genetically heterogeneous in Arabs, with 53 mutations in 15 genes. Thirteen of these mutations are potentially founder mutations for the region.

JS is genetically highly heterogeneous, with at least 29 disease genes being involved. To further understand the genetic causes of JS, we performed whole-exome sequencing in 24 newly recruited JS families. Together with six previously reported families, we identified causative mutations in 25 out of 30 (24 + 6) families (83.3%). We identified eight mutated genes in 27 (21 + 6) Japanese families, TMEM67 (7/27, 25.9%) and CEP290 (6/27, 22.2%) were the most commonly mutated. Interestingly, 9 of 12 CEP290 disease alleles were c.6012-12T>A (75.0%), an allele that has not been reported in non-Japanese populations. Therefore c.6012-12T>A is a common allele in the Japanese population. Importantly, one Japanese and one Omani families carried compound biallelic mutations in two distinct genes (TMEM67/RPGRIP1L and TMEM138/BBS1, respectively).

In 50 cases, there was a causative mutation in a known monogenic disease gene. In 32 of these cases whole exome sequencing confirmed the diagnosis of a nephronophthisis-related ciliopathy. In 8 cases it revealed the diagnosis of a renal tubulopathy. The remaining 10 cases were identified as Alport syndrome (4), autosomal-recessive polycystic kidney disease (2), congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (3), and APECED syndrome (1). In 5 families, in whom mutations in known monogenic genes were excluded, we applied homozygosity mapping for variant filtering and identified 5 novel candidate genes (RBM48, FAM186B, PIAS1, INCENP, and RCOR1) for renal ciliopathies.

This complex transiently interacts with rhodopsin to facilitate IFT powered by different types of motorsalong actin and/or microtubule tracks. Disruption of Tmem138 results in a defective CC complex (mislocalization of Ahi1 and Tmem231), impeding rhodop-sin (possibly some other OS proteins as well) entering and/or traveling across the CC.

Retinal dystrophies with underlying CC defects are manifested in a broad array of syndromic conditions known as ciliopathies as well as nonsyndromic retinal degenerations. Despite extensive studies, many questions remain in the mechanism of protein trafficking across the photoreceptor CC. Here, we genetically inactivated mouse Tmem138, a gene encoding a putative transmembrane protein localized to the ciliary TZ and linked to ciliopathies. Germline deletion of Tmem138 abolished OS morphogenesis, followed by rapid photoreceptor degeneration. Tmem138 was found localized to the photoreceptor CC and was required for localization of Ahi1 to the distal subdomain of the CC. Among the examined set of OS proteins, rhodopsin was mislocalized throughout the mutant cell body prior to OS morphogenesis. Ablation of Tmem138 in mature rods recapitulated the molecular changes in the germline mutants, causing failure of disc renewal and disintegration of the OS. Furthermore, Tmem138 interacts reciprocally with rhodopsin and a related protein Tmem231, and the ciliary localization of the latter was also altered in the mutant photoreceptors. Taken together, these results suggest a crucial role of Tmem138 in the functional organization of the CC, which is essential for rhodopsin localization and OS biogenesis.","dc:creator":"Guo D","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Tmem138 is localized to the connecting cilium essential for rhodopsin localization and outer segment biogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Guo TMEM138 - TMEM231/AHI1/RHODOPSIN"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:737929ad-8732-4dd5-8f3d-0c66916d66f2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8f3bfcf4-e1d1-430b-b458-3f052c67a1e6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Figs.

Multiple disease entities have been reported in association with this gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was no evidence of differences in their molecular mechanisms, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic spectrum. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: Joubert syndrome 16 (OMIM:614465) (PMID: 22282472, 27081510, 27434533, 26489029, 28102635, 29620724, 34821546, 34354814), Meckel syndrome (PMID: 22282472, 23351400, 27894351), and Orofaciodigital syndrome (PMID: 28289185, 27434533). The preferred disease name suggested for this disorder is autosomal recessive ciliopathy. \n\n*TMEM138* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive ciliopathy in 2012 (Lee et al., PMID: 22282472). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. The reported patients presented clinical features consistent with ciliopathies including neurodevelopmental delay, molar tooth sign on brain MRI, encephalocele, ocular coloboma, oculomotor apraxia, cystic kidney disease, nephronophthisis, and polydactyly.\n\nAt least nine variants (missense, splice site, frameshift) reported in nineteen probands in eleven publications (PMIDs: 22282472, 28102635, 23351400, 34821546, 27081510, 27434533, 34354814, 29620724, 26489029, 27894351, 28289185) are included in this curation. The majority of the variants were missense, with functional data indicating that missense variants result in decreased production of wild-type protein and shortened cilia in patient fibroblasts (PMID: 22282472). A total of 4.6/12 pts. genetic evidence was reached, considering case-level data. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (e.g. animal models, expression studies, in vitro functional assays, etc.) (PMIDs: 22282472, 35394880). It is shown that the gene is expressed in all major tissues and that inactivation leads to ciliopathy-like features in model systems. The protein is crucial for ciliary assembly and interacts with other ciliopathy proteins,  A total of 4/6 pts. experimental evidence was reached.\n\nIn summary, there is “Moderate” evidence supporting the relationship between *TMEM138* and autosomal recessive ciliopathy. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 04/25/2023 (SOP Version 9].\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c7ebf874-24b0-4566-bc51-8e4dad4b0fb9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
