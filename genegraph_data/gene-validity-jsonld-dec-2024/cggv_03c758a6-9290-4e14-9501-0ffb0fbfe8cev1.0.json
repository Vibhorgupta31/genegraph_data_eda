Direct sequencing of SNTA1, the gene encoding alpha1-syntrophin, was performed in a cohort of LQTS patients that were negative for mutations in the 11 known LQTS-susceptibility genes. A missense mutation (A390V-SNTA1) was found in a patient with recurrent syncope and markedly prolonged QT interval (QTc, 530 ms). SNTA1 links neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) to the nNOS inhibitor plasma membrane Ca-ATPase subtype 4b (PMCA4b); SNTA1 also is known to associate with the cardiac sodium channel SCN5A. By using a GST-fusion protein of the C terminus of SCN5A, we showed that WT-SNTA1 interacted with SCN5A, nNOS, and PMCA4b. In contrast, A390V-SNTA1 selectively disrupted association of PMCA4b with this complex and increased direct nitrosylation of SCN5A. A390V-SNTA1 expressed with SCN5A, nNOS, and PMCA4b in heterologous cells increased peak and late sodium current compared with WT-SNTA1, and the increase was partially inhibited by NOS blockers. Expression of A390V-SNTA1 in cardiac myocytes also increased late sodium current. We conclude that the A390V mutation disrupted binding with PMCA4b, released inhibition of nNOS, caused S-nitrosylation of SCN5A, and was associated with increased late sodium current, which is the characteristic biophysical dysfunction for sodium-channel-mediated LQTS (LQT3). These results establish an SNTA1-based nNOS complex attached to SCN5A as a key regulator of sodium current and suggest that SNTA1 be considered a rare LQTS-susceptibility gene.","dc:creator":"Ueda K","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Syntrophin mutation associated with long QT syndrome through activation of the nNOS-SCN5A macromolecular complex."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18591664","rdfs:label":"Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b29d33a8-7635-4ba4-8d76-122a78f90b20_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:40b9932f-c6ac-4bb0-b14c-7bfdc46cc0e7","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":17,"detectionMethod":"Using polymerase chain reaction and direct DNA sequencing, open reading frame/splice site mutational analysis was performed on the SNTA1 gene (chromosome 20q11.2; 8 exons).\nPolymerase chain reaction amplification was performed using primers designed to flank the\nregions of this gene.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001279","obo:HP_0005184"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Previously screened for the known LQTS-susceptibility genes (LQT1–9).","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:b29d33a8-7635-4ba4-8d76-122a78f90b20_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:5eae69ca-b6c4-440f-bfa3-1cee3e1d52b3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003098.2(SNTA1):c.770C>G (p.Ala257Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/191548"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19684871","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Long-QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited disorder associated with sudden cardiac death.

Few variants in the cardiac NaV1.5 Na+ channel complex have been associated with diLQTS. We tested whether a novel SNTA1 (α1-syntrophin) variant (p.E409Q) found in a patient with diLQTS increases late sodium current (INa-L), thereby providing a disease mechanism. Electrophysiological studies were performed in HEK293T cells co-expressing human NaV1.5/nNOS/PMCA4b with either wild type (WT) or SNTA1 variants (A390V-previously reported in congenital LQTS; and E409Q); and in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes infected with SNTA1 expressing adenoviruses (WT or one of the two SNTA1 variants). In HEK293T cells and in cardiomyocytes, there was no significant difference in the peak INa densities among the SNTA1 WT and variants. However, both variants increased INa-L (% of peak current) in HEK293T cells (0.58 ± 0.10 in WT vs. 0.90 ± 0.11 in A390V, p = 0.048; vs. 0.88 ± 0.07 in E409Q, p = 0.023). In cardiomyocytes, INa-L was significantly increased by E409Q, but not by A390V compared to WT (0.49 ± 0.14 in WT vs.0.94 ± 0.23 in A390V, p = 0.099; vs. 1.12 ± 0.24 in E409Q, p = 0.019). We demonstrated that a novel SNTA1 variant is likely causative for diLQTS by augmenting INa-L.
