After exclusion of mutations in genes underlying progressive inherited retinal disorders, by targeted next generation sequencing, a 32 year-old male sporadic case with severe rod-cone dystrophy and his unaffected parents were investigated by whole exome sequencing. This led to the identification of a homozygous nonsense variant, c.963C>A p.(Cys321*) in GNAT1, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The mother was heterozygous for this variant whereas the variant was absent in the father. c.963C>A p.(Cys321*) is predicted to produce a shorter protein that lacks critical sites for the phototransduction cascade.

Upon activation by photoactivated rhodopsin, GDP is released from T-alpha and exchanged for GTP. T-alpha then dissociates from T-beta/gamma and binds the inhibitory gamma subunit of phsophodiesterase, allowing the alpha/beta subunits of PDE to hydrolyze cGMP. This results in closure of cGMP-gated channels, and hyperpolarization of the cell (PMID: 16269358).\n\n*GNAT1* associated with 2 disorders in OMIM – “Night blindness, congenital stationary, type 1G” (MIM# 616389) which is autosomal recessive; and “Night blindness, congenital stationary, autosomal dominant 3” (MIM# 610444). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in the inheritance pattern for these two conditions (as indicated by OMIM), and potentially a difference in the molecular mechanism. There is clear autosomal dominant inheritance in large pedigrees (PMID: 8673138; PMID: 17584859), while the heterozygous parents of biallelic affected individuals have appear to no signs of the condition upon detailed ophthalmological evaluation including electroretinogram (ERG) (PMID: 22190596; PMID: 26472407; PMID: 31696758) supporting autosomal recessive inheritance in these families. In addition, two missense variants that segregate in autosomal dominant pedigrees and that have been supported by functional studies, p.Gly38Asp and p.Gln200Glu, appear to result in constitutive activation of the visual transduction cascade (PMIDs: 10702259, 16793893 24009494), while the mechanism for variants identified in biallelic cases is likely to be loss of function. Therefore, these two conditions have been curated separately. Further functional studies are needed to better understand the role of different variants in *GNAT1*. Because the phenotype varies in individuals with biallelic variants in GNAT1, all cases have been lumped under “*GNAT1*-related recessive retinopathy”. While there is a possible genotype/phenotype correlation between C-terminal deletions resulting in retinal degeneration while other variants cause a more typical congenital stationary night blindness, additional evidence is needed before these conditions are split.\n\nFive variants (one missense, one in-frame deletion, one frameshift, two C-terminal nonsense variants) that have been reported in five probands in five publications (PMID: 22190596; PMID: 26472407; PMID: 27977773; PMID: 31696758; PMID: 31736247) are included in this curation. Segregation evidence was also included (PMID: 22190596). An additional case was not included due to scant clinical details and because the variants were not confirmed to be in trans PMID: 33691693) (Total genetic evidence = 6.7 points).\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including the important role of the gene product of *GNAT1* (the alpha-subunit of transducin) in the phototransduction cascade, which is consistent with the phenotype of individuals with damaging variants in the gene (PMID: 16269358); its interaction with the products of other genes known to be involved in retinopathy, including *RHO *(PMID: 31300275); and recapitulation of the phenotype in natural and laboratory-generated mouse models (PMID: 19766629; PMID: 11095744). Additional evidence is available in the literature but the maximum points for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *GNAT1* and autosomal recessive retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. The classification of novel variants in *GNAT1* may be challenging, given that this gene is also associated with autosomal dominant retinopathy. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 7, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c88f15f7-5f50-4de4-9dbb-50cf4f98f122"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
