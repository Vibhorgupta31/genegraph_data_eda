The conserved Notch signaling pathway contributes to the development and homeostasis of multiple tissues, including skeletal muscle. We studied an international cohort of 23 individuals with genetically unsolved muscular dystrophy from 13 unrelated families. Whole-exome sequencing identified rare homozygous or compound heterozygous JAG2 variants in all 13 families. The identified bi-allelic variants include 10 missense variants that disrupt highly conserved amino acids, a nonsense variant, two frameshift variants, an in-frame deletion, and a microdeletion encompassing JAG2. Onset of muscle weakness occurred from infancy to young adulthood. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels were normal or mildly elevated. Muscle histology was primarily dystrophic. MRI of the lower extremities revealed a distinct, slightly asymmetric pattern of muscle involvement with cores of preserved and affected muscles in quadriceps and tibialis anterior, in some cases resembling patterns seen in POGLUT1-associated muscular dystrophy. Transcriptome analysis of muscle tissue from two participants suggested misregulation of genes involved in myogenesis, including PAX7. In complementary studies, Jag2 downregulation in murine myoblasts led to downregulation of multiple components of the Notch pathway, including Megf10. Investigations in Drosophila suggested an interaction between Serrate and Drpr, the fly orthologs of JAG1/JAG2 and MEGF10, respectively. In silico analysis predicted that many Jagged2 missense variants are associated with structural changes and protein misfolding. In summary, we describe a muscular dystrophy associated with pathogenic variants in JAG2 and evidence suggests a disease mechanism related to Notch pathway dysfunction.","dc:creator":"Coppens S","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"A form of muscular dystrophy associated with pathogenic variants in JAG2."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:16f43ce9-05b5-437d-a35e-b1c379c0ba7a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:16f43ce9-05b5-437d-a35e-b1c379c0ba7a_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:81312302-0c31-484b-aabf-7ce6c36d4e00","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:05a48c8d-2dd7-4061-adda-e4f198e24913","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"JAG2 is involved in Notch signaling; other genes involved in Notch signaling have been associated with disease but lacking strong phenotype overlap with a primarily muscular dystrophy phenotype.

Mice homozygous for this deletion die perinatally because of defects in craniofacial morphogenesis. The mutant homozygotes exhibit cleft palate and fusion of the tongue with the palatal shelves. The mutant mice also exhibit syndactyly (digit fusions) of the fore- and hindlimbs.

JAG2 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy in 2021 (Coppens et al., PMID: 33861953). Among the 27 patients from 16 families described to date, symptom onset ranges from infancy to adolescence/young adulthood. Muscle weakness is typically progressive with lower extremity and proximal dominance; loss of ambulation occurs in a subset of individuals. Reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes are common, and serum CK is normal or mildly elevated. Muscle biopsy findings are primarily dystrophic but may also include myopathic features. Additional features observed in some patients include scoliosis, joint contractures, ptosis and mild facial weakness, muscle atrophy or hypertrophy, cardiac features, asymptomatic moderate respiratory muscle weakness, intellectual disability or global developmental delay, speech delay, and autism spectrum disorder. Eighteen variants (13 missense, 1 in-frame indel, 1 nonsense, 2 frameshift, and 1 large deletion) reported in 16 probands in three publications (PMID: 33861953, 34878394, 39121631) are included in this curation. Co-segregation of JAG2 variants in affected family members was observed in multiple families, including three with at least three affected individuals. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. However, additional investigation is needed as the effects of missense variants on gene function have not yet been determined, and many missense variants were identified in a homozygous state, often in consanguineous families. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including altered Notch pathway gene expression in patient muscle tissue and murine myoblasts following shRNA-mediated JAG2 knockdown as well as age-related locomotor decline in Drosophila following RNAi-mediated downregulation of Serrate (JAG2 ortholog)-dependent Notch signaling in adult muscle progenitors (PMID: 33861953, 39121631). In summary, there is moderate evidence supporting the relationship between JAG2 and autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
