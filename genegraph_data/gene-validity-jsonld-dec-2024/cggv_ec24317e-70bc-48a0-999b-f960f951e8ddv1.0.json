It encodes a protein with several domains also present in CENPF, a protein involved in chromosome segregation. CEP290 (also known as NPHP6) interacts with and modulates the activity of ATF4, a transcription factor implicated in cAMP-dependent renal cyst formation. NPHP6 is found at centrosomes and in the nucleus of renal epithelial cells in a cell cycle-dependent manner and in connecting cilia of photoreceptors. Abrogation of its function in zebrafish recapitulates the renal, retinal and cerebellar phenotypes of Joubert syndrome.

To explore the mechanisms of the human retinal disease, we studied CEP290-LCA in patients of different ages (7-48 years) and compared results to Cep290-mutant mice. Unexpectedly, blind CEP290-mutant human retinas retained photoreceptor and inner laminar architecture in the cone-rich central retina, independent of severity of visual loss. Surrounding the cone-rich island was photoreceptor loss and distorted retina, suggesting neural-glial remodeling. The mutant mouse retina at 4-6 weeks of age showed similar features of retinal remodeling, with altered neural and synaptic laminae and Muller glial activation. The visual brain pathways in CEP290-LCA were anatomically intact.

Hitherto, 13 LCA genes have been mapped, nine of which have been identified. Recently, mutations in the NPHP6/CEP290 gene were shown to account for Joubert and Senior-Loken syndromes and to represent a frequent cause of isolated LCA. All LCA patients shared an intronic mutation resulting in an aberrantly spliced transcript and low levels of wild-type transcript that was believed to explain the absence of cerebellar and renal involvement in these patients. Here, we confirm the high frequency of NPHP6/CEP290 mutations in our series of LCA families hailing worldwide (22%). However, we show that conversely to other LCA genes, NPHP6 is involved in families of European descent only (38/38). A total of 24 different mutations were found, 23 of which are novel (one founder mutation in the North region of France). All mutations but two were either nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site changes. The common NPHP6/CEP290 intronic mutation accounted for 43% (33/76) of all disease alleles. Twelve families did not carry this common intronic mutation. At least 10 out of them harboured two mutations expected to truncate the protein questioning the relevance of the assumption according to which the retinal-restricted phenotype in LCA patient could be due to a residual NPHP6/CEP290 activity. Finally, we show that all patients were affected with the cone-rod subtype of the disease whatever their NPHP6/CEP290 genotype.","dc:creator":"Perrault I","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Spectrum of NPHP6/CEP290 mutations in Leber congenital amaurosis and delineation of the associated phenotype."}},"rdfs:label":"818"},{"id":"cggv:c99325bf-7b62-4379-8762-0dedb4e71a82","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c99325bf-7b62-4379-8762-0dedb4e71a82_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:89fedbdb-2254-442f-916b-c021e0d31b5e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:89fedbdb-2254-442f-916b-c021e0d31b5e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":18,"allele":{"id":"cggv:d8401795-785c-4f7d-8b19-4da47ec9f132"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:59290cc6-d347-499c-bb53-f98fcc9760dd_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d8401795-785c-4f7d-8b19-4da47ec9f132"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17345604"},"rdfs:label":"831"},{"id":"cggv:59290cc6-d347-499c-bb53-f98fcc9760dd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:59290cc6-d347-499c-bb53-f98fcc9760dd_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"downgrade because homozygous per retina GCEP"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9ce98f4a-1d8b-4058-8ee9-5a34fd894cfa_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9ce98f4a-1d8b-4058-8ee9-5a34fd894cfa","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:87050533-ff6e-4aec-9f33-b194161c36d6"},{"id":"cggv:844bef59-21db-4f0a-9d57-e9c313247e40","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_025114.4(CEP290):c.4656del (p.Glu1553fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA227970"}}],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:035a986d-1833-4d74-bedd-e9291347c30e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:87050533-ff6e-4aec-9f33-b194161c36d6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16682973"},{"id":"cggv:c450765c-9da0-4b9f-baf2-fcfa697b2df8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:844bef59-21db-4f0a-9d57-e9c313247e40"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16682973"}],"rdfs:label":"F63 II-1"},{"id":"cggv:c450765c-9da0-4b9f-baf2-fcfa697b2df8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c450765c-9da0-4b9f-baf2-fcfa697b2df8_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:035a986d-1833-4d74-bedd-e9291347c30e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:035a986d-1833-4d74-bedd-e9291347c30e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:be161c52-ac97-4e13-ae2d-08a608864ecb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be161c52-ac97-4e13-ae2d-08a608864ecb","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"cggv:60d7bfa5-3fe0-46bb-bd6d-4a3b1967342f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_025114.4(CEP290):c.21G>T (p.Trp7Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA227962"}},"detectionMethod":"Genome-wide screen;

JS is genetically highly heterogeneous, with at least 29 disease genes being involved. To further understand the genetic causes of JS, we performed whole-exome sequencing in 24 newly recruited JS families. Together with six previously reported families, we identified causative mutations in 25 out of 30 (24 + 6) families (83.3%). We identified eight mutated genes in 27 (21 + 6) Japanese families, TMEM67 (7/27, 25.9%) and CEP290 (6/27, 22.2%) were the most commonly mutated. Interestingly, 9 of 12 CEP290 disease alleles were c.6012-12T>A (75.0%), an allele that has not been reported in non-Japanese populations. Therefore c.6012-12T>A is a common allele in the Japanese population.

The defect is caused by an intronic mutation (c.2991+1655A-->G) that creates a strong splice-donor site and inserts a cryptic exon in the CEP290 messenger RNA. This mutation was detected in 16 (21%) of 76 unrelated patients with LCA, either homozygously or in combination with a second deleterious mutation on the other allele.

syndromes with phenotypes including cerebellar hypoplasia, retinal dystrophy and nephronophthisis (a cystic kidney disease). We have utilised the MRC-Wellcome Trust Human Developmental Biology Resource (HDBR), to perform in-situ hybridisation studies on embryonic tissues, revealing an early onset neuronal, retinal and renal expression pattern for AHI1. An almost identical pattern of expression is seen with CEP290 in human embryonic and fetal tissue. A novel finding is that both AHI1 and CEP290 demonstrate strong expression within the developing choroid plexus, a ciliated structure important for central nervous system development. To test if AHI1 and CEP290 may have co-evolved, we carried out a genomic survey of a large group of organisms across eukaryotic evolution. We found that, in animals, ahi1 and cep290 are almost always found together; however in other organisms either one may be found independent of the other. Finally, we tested in murine epithelial cells if Ahi1 was required for recruitment of Cep290 to the centrosome. We found no obvious differences in Cep290 localisation in the presence or absence of Ahi1, suggesting that, while Ahi1 and Cep290 may function together in the whole organism, they are not interdependent for localisation within a single cell. Taken together these data support a role for AHI1 and CEP290 in multiple organs throughout development and we suggest that this accounts for the wide phenotypic spectrum of AHI1 and CEP290 mutations in man.","dc:creator":"Cheng YZ","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Investigating embryonic expression patterns and evolution of AHI1 and CEP290 genes, implicated in Joubert syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"In situ hybridization human embryonic tissue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:bfcb7d78-1121-43a6-94da-7834de2f7215","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a918bea1-ba26-459a-af7f-2758e11ea46a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"30 hpf larva and 48 hpf, expression in developing cerebellum & retina, near lens compared to mismatch morpholino","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16682973","rdfs:label":"Zebrafish larva expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:62f5d17d-d51e-402f-a570-2df362226004","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:147bd690-7a42-4629-b2e3-3e64ac16234e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"immunohistochemical analysis of WT mouse retina CEP290 detected in\nthe connecting cilia","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16632484","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Centrosome- and cilia-associated proteins play crucial roles in establishing polarity and regulating intracellular transport in post-mitotic cells.

We demonstrate that CEP290 localizes primarily to centrosomes of dividing cells and to the connecting cilium of retinal photoreceptors. We show that, in the retina, CEP290 associates with several microtubule-based transport proteins including RPGR, which is mutated in approximately 15% of patients with retinitis pigmentosa. A truncated CEP290 protein (DeltaCEP290) is detected in the rd16 retina, but in considerably reduced amounts; however, the mutant protein exhibits stronger association with specific RPGR isoform(s). Immunogold labeling studies demonstrate the redistribution of RPGR and of phototransduction proteins in the photoreceptors of rd16 retina.

Several extrarenal manifestations characterize this disorder, including cerebellar defects, situs inversus and retinitis pigmentosa. While the clinical manifestations vary significantly in NPHP, mutations of NPHP5 and NPHP6 are always associated with progressive blindness. This clinical finding suggests that the gene products, nephrocystin-5 and nephrocystin-6, participate in overlapping signaling pathways to maintain photoreceptor homeostasis. To analyze the genetic interaction between these two proteins in more detail, we studied zebrafish embryos after depletion of NPHP5 and NPHP6. Knockdown of zebrafish zNPHP5 and zNPHP6 produced similar phenotypes, and synergistic effects were observed after the combined knockdown of zNPHP5 and zNPHP6. The N-terminal domain of nephrocystin-6-bound nephrocystin-5, and mapping studies delineated the interacting site from amino acid 696 to 896 of NPHP6. In Xenopus laevis, knockdown of NPHP5 caused substantial neural tube closure defects. This phenotype was copied by expression of the nephrocystin-5-binding fragment of nephrocystin-6, and rescued by co-expression of nephrocystin-5, supporting a physical interaction between both gene products in vivo. Since the N- and C-terminal fragments of nephrocystin-6 engage in the formation of homo- and heteromeric protein complexes, conformational changes seem to regulate the interaction of nephrocystin-6 with its binding partners.","dc:creator":"Schäfer T","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Genetic and physical interaction between the NPHP5 and NPHP6 gene products."},"rdfs:label":"NPHP5/IQCB1 immunoprecipitation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b45daf50-b89e-49c7-a443-1ff02fd09b91","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1e9ece7e-e78d-4519-bc35-4cfa65ba2242","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"CEP290 associates with RPGR-ORF15 in the retina","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16632484","rdfs:label":"Immunocytochemistry RPGR-ORF15"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:ec24317e-70bc-48a0-999b-f960f951e8dd_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a4fcc5db-ee41-44c2-89ee-8d2792b54359","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:183f3d4b-d016-4526-8e4c-85d110f6a16e","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"impaired ability to form cilia in patient-derived cells.

A lentiviral vector containing CMV-driven human full-length CEP290 was constructed. Following transduction of patient-specific, iPSC-derived, photoreceptor precursor cells, reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis and western blotting revealed vector-derived expression.

In cultures derived from these patients, fewer cells formed cilia compared with unaffected controls. Cilia that were formed were shorter in patient-derived cells than in cells from unaffected individuals. Importantly, lentiviral delivery of CEP290 rescued the ciliogenesis defect.

An initial screen of 39 candidate genes and genomic locations failed to detect linkage to cat rdAc. Linkage was ultimately established on cat B4 with 15 simple tandem repeat markers (logarithm of odds [LOD] range 4.83-15.53, Theta = 0.0), in a region demonstrating conserved synteny to human chromosome 12, 84.9-90.63 Mb. The sequence of 10 genes with feline retinal expression was examined in affected and unaffected individuals. A single-nucleotide polymorphism was characterized in intron 50 of CEP290 (IVS50 + 9T>G) that creates a strong canonical splice donor site, resulting in a 4-bp insertion and frameshift in the mRNA transcript, with subsequent introduction of a stop codon and premature truncation of the protein. A population genetic survey of 136 cats demonstrated that the rdAc mutation is in low frequency in Abyssinian populations (0.13, Sweden; 0.07, United States) and absent in breeds of non-Abyssinian heritage. Mutations in CEP290 have recently been shown to cause two human diseases, Joubert syndrome, a syndromic retinal degeneration, and Leber's congenital amaurosis, an AR early-onset retinal dystrophy.

Sayer et al., 2006 (PMID: 16682973) reported CEP290 variants in 7 families with Joubert syndrome and 1 with Senior-Loken syndrome; Valente et al., 2006 (PMID: 16682970) reported CEP290 variants in 5 families with Joubert syndrome related disorders; and den Hollander et al., 2006 (PMID: 16909394) reported CEP290 variants in 4 siblings with Leber congenital amaurosis. At least 300 mutations have been reported in humans, including frameshift, nonsense, splice site, missense, and large deletions. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. 11 CEP290 gene variants that have been reported in 19 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 17345604, 16909394, 24807808, 16682970, 16682973, 27434533) are included in this curation. In particular, multiple probands were found to have a deep intronic CEP290 variant, c.2991+1655A>G, which is common among patients in the United States and Northwest Europe. This variant is commonly associated with non-syndromic retinal disease and has been shown to create cryptic exon and has been shown to result in mix of nonsense p.Cys998* and wild-type protein (PMID: 16909394). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The CEP290 gene has been associated with at least five conditions, Leber congenital amaurosis (MIM 611755), Bardet-Biedl syndrome (MIM 615991), Joubert syndrome (MIM 610188), Meckel syndrome (MIM 611134), and Senior-Loken syndrome (610189). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern. In addition, there are not clear genotype-phenotype correlations for CEP290 conditions. Recent studies (PMID: 31879347; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.26.477596) suggest that that this variation in phenotype may be due to genetic modifiers for CEP290-related conditions. For this curation, the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, CEP290-related ciliopathy (MONDO: 0100451). The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function/reduced function. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. CEP290 is expressed in the developing human kidney and brain (PMID: 23028714), the developing zebrafish cerebellum and retina (PMID: 16682973), and the mouse retina (PMID: 16632484). In vitro, CEP290 has been shown to interact with RPGR, a gene associated with inherited retinal disease (PMID 16632484) and NPHP5/IQCB1, a gene associated with Senior-Loken syndrome/nephronophthisis (PMID: 18723859). A zebrafish morpholino knockout resulted in a phenotype similar to Joubert syndrome with neurologic, ocular, and renal differences (PMID: 16682973). Furthermore, in human fibroblast cultures, CEP290 mutations have been shown to induce a ciliogenesis defect (PMID: 24807808). There are two naturally occurring animal models for CEP290-related disease, both exhibiting retinal phenotypes. The rd16 mouse is a naturally occurring mutant mouse with in-frame CEP290 deletion. These mice exhibit early-onset retinal dystrophy with severely reduced ERG and abnormal retinal histology (PMID 16632484, 17554762). There is also a linage of cats, originally identified in Sweden, with late-onset recessive retinal degeneration that were found to have a CEP290 intronic variant that creates canonical splice donor site and ultimately premature protein truncation (PMID: 17507457). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 pts.) has been reached. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between CEP290 and CEP290-related ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease clinical validity classification was approved by the Retina GCEP on February 3, 2022.
