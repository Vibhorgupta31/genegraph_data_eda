ASXL proteins consist of ASXN, ASXH, ASXM1, ASXM2 and PHD domains. ASXL1 directly interacts with BAP1, KDM1A (LSD1), NCOA1 and nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs), such as retinoic acid receptors, oestrogen receptor and androgen receptor. ASXL family members are epigenetic scaffolding proteins that assemble epigenetic regulators and transcription factors to specific genomic loci with histone modifications. ASXL1 is involved in transcriptional repression through an interaction with PRC2 and also contributes to transcriptional regulation through interactions with BAP1 and/or NHR complexes. Germ-line mutations of human ASXL1 and ASXL3 occur in Bohring-Opitz and related syndromes. Amplification and overexpression of ASXL1 occur in cervical cancer. Truncation mutations of ASXL1 occur in colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI), malignant myeloid diseases, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and liver, prostate and breast cancers; those of ASXL2 occur in prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and breast cancer and those of ASXL3 are observed in melanoma. EPC1-ASXL2 gene fusion occurs in adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma. The prognosis of myeloid malignancies with misregulating truncation mutations of ASXL1 is poor.

ASXL1 encodes a chromatin binding protein involved in transcriptional regulation. Bohring-Opitz syndrome is characterized by intrauterine growth restriction, feeding difficulties, developmental delay/intellectual disability, and distinctive dysmorphic facial features, and posture. \n \nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. At least 27 unique variants (nonsense and frameshift) have been reported in 34 probands in 14 publications (PMIDs: 21706002, 25921057, 33529703, 28229513, 30147881, 31692235, 22419483, 31819025, 29681100, 26364555, 27043953, 29681105, 31969346, 30806792) included in this curation. Variants are de novo in most probands though inheritance from a mosaic parent has been reported (PMIDs: 29681100, 33751773). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Acquired somatic mosaicism of ASXL1 variants, including variants noted in individuals with Bohring-Opitz syndrome, can occur with aging in healthy individuals during hematopoietic clonal expansion (PMID: 28229513). This explains the presence of a large number of cases with somatic truncating variants in population databases such as gnomAD. \n \nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence. The ASXL gene family (ASXL1, ASXL2, and ASXL3) participates in body patterning during embryogenesis and encodes proteins involved in epigenetic and transcriptional regulation (PMID: 23736028). Germline de novo truncating variants in ASXL2 and ASXL3 have been implicated in Shashi-Pena and Bainbridge-Ropers syndromes, which result in overlapping features of intellectual disability and dysmorphic features (PMIDs: 27693232, 23383720). \n \nIn summary, ASXL1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Bohring-Opitz syndrome. This classification was approved by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 07/30/2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:31e0ce4d-aeb7-4983-9ec2-85178d7f40f0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
