We have also described a haplotype that is shared by more than 80% of FCMD chromosomes, indicating that most chromosomes bearing the FCMD mutation could be derived from a single ancestor. Here we report that there is a retrotransposal insertion of tandemly repeated sequences within this candidate-gene interval in all FCMD chromosomes carrying the founder haplotype (87%). The inserted sequence is about 3 kilobases long and is located in the 3' untranslated region of a gene encoding a new 461-amino-acid protein. This gene is expressed in various tissues in normal individuals, but not in FCMD patients who carry the insertion. Two independent point mutations confirm that mutation of this gene is responsible for FCMD.

In FCMD, the SVA insertion occurs in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the fukutin gene. The pathogenic mechanism for FCMD is unknown, and no effective clinical treatments exist. Here we show that aberrant messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing, induced by SVA exon-trapping, underlies the molecular pathogenesis of FCMD. Quantitative mRNA analysis pinpointed a region that was missing from transcripts in patients with FCMD. This region spans part of the 3' end of the fukutin coding region, a proximal part of the 3' UTR and the SVA insertion. Correspondingly, fukutin mRNA transcripts in patients with FCMD and SVA knock-in model mice were shorter than the expected length. Sequence analysis revealed an abnormal splicing event, provoked by a strong acceptor site in SVA and a rare alternative donor site in fukutin exon 10. The resulting product truncates the fukutin carboxy (C) terminus and adds 129 amino acids encoded by the SVA. Introduction of antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting the splice acceptor, the predicted exonic splicing enhancer and the intronic splicing enhancer prevented pathogenic exon-trapping by SVA in cells of patients with FCMD and model mice, rescuing normal fukutin mRNA expression and protein production. AON treatment also restored fukutin functions, including O-glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG) and laminin binding by α-DG. Moreover, we observe exon-trapping in other SVA insertions associated with disease (hypercholesterolemia, neutral lipid storage disease) and human-specific SVA insertion in a novel gene. Thus, although splicing into SVA is known, we have discovered in human disease a role for SVA-mediated exon-trapping and demonstrated the promise of splicing modulation therapy as the first radical clinical treatment for FCMD and other SVA-mediated diseases.","dc:creator":"Taniguchi-Ikeda M","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Pathogenic exon-trapping by SVA retrotransposon and rescue in Fukuyama muscular dystrophy."},"rdfs:label":"Taniguchi-Ikeda_FA"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:54e23f1a-3b1b-49ef-aa02-6b46374b1546_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:48ae03bd-fa00-49d7-a1c6-fa3e12bcddf7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f305b06b-21f9-4c47-ae87-ceddfcf1b4bc","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Corrected fukutin mRNA was restored to 50% or more of the levels seen in normal controls.

A retrotransposal insertion in fukutin is seen in almost all cases of FCMD. To better understand the molecular pathogenesis of dystroglycanopathies and to explore therapeutic strategies, we generated knock-in mice carrying the retrotransposal insertion in the mouse fukutin ortholog. Knock-in mice exhibited hypoglycosylated alpha-dystroglycan; however, no signs of muscular dystrophy were observed. More sensitive methods detected minor levels of intact alpha-dystroglycan, and solid-phase assays determined laminin binding levels to be approximately 50% of normal. In contrast, intact alpha-dystroglycan is undetectable in the dystrophic Large(myd) mouse, and laminin-binding activity is markedly reduced. These data indicate that a small amount of intact alpha-dystroglycan is sufficient to maintain muscle cell integrity in knock-in mice, suggesting that the treatment of dystroglycanopathies might not require the full recovery of glycosylation. To examine whether glycosylation defects can be restored in vivo, we performed mouse gene transfer experiments. Transfer of fukutin into knock-in mice restored glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. In addition, transfer of LARGE produced laminin-binding forms of alpha-dystroglycan in both knock-in mice and the POMGnT1 mutant mouse, which is another model of dystroglycanopathy.

The essential role of dystroglycan in development has hampered elucidation of the mechanisms underlying dystroglycanopathies. Here, we developed a dystroglycanopathy mouse model using inducible or muscle-specific promoters to conditionally disrupt fukutin (Fktn), a gene required for dystroglycan processing. In conditional Fktn-KO mice, we observed a near absence of functionally glycosylated dystroglycan within 18 days of gene deletion. Twenty-week-old KO mice showed clear dystrophic histopathology and a defect in glycosylation near the dystroglycan O-mannose phosphate, whether onset of Fktn excision driven by muscle-specific promoters occurred at E8 or E17. However, the earlier gene deletion resulted in more severe phenotypes, with a faster onset of damage and weakness, reduced weight and viability, and regenerating fibers of smaller size. The dependence of phenotype severity on the developmental timing of muscle Fktn deletion supports a role for dystroglycan in muscle development or differentiation. Moreover, given that this conditional Fktn-KO mouse allows the generation of tissue- and timing-specific defects in dystroglycan glycosylation, avoids embryonic lethality, and produces a phenotype resembling patient pathology, it is a promising new model for the study of secondary dystroglycanopathy.","dc:creator":"Beedle AM","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mouse fukutin deletion impairs dystroglycan processing and recapitulates muscular dystrophy."},"rdfs:label":"Beedle_Conditional KO mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"cggv:54e23f1a-3b1b-49ef-aa02-6b46374b1546_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e8b9f8bc-b7d5-4412-a202-8b385aafe3a7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e8b9f8bc-b7d5-4412-a202-8b385aafe3a7","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:852e2b5e-6984-4c72-941b-a4a13d23e742","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006731.2(FKTN):c.*4392_*4393ins[AB185332.1]","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/3199"}},{"id":"cggv:8e78870a-2cc6-4964-94f0-3cc6827c37a5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001079802.2(FKTN):c.187_188del (p.Met63ValfsTer13)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA116059"}}],"detectionMethod":"Southern blot of genomic DNA from FCMD patient revealed a 3062 bp retrotransposal insertion in the 3'UTR of 1 FKTN allele.

This association was made using case-level and experimental data. The *FKTN* gene is located on chromosome 9q31.2 and encodes multiple transcript variants. The commonly referred transcript (NM_001079802.2) is 7.4 kb long with 10 exons encoding a 461-amino acid protein. More than 70 pathogenic variants reported in humans with autosomal recessive myopathy caused by variation in FKTN are recorded in ClinVar, ranging from small deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift and splicing to missense variants. Myopathy caused by variation in FKTN encompasses a spectrum of phenotypes including severe forms with muscle-eye-brain disease, Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy and Walker-Warburg syndrome and milder forms of muscular dystrophy dystroglycanopathy without intellectual disability, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. Patients often show an elevated serum creatine kinase and progressive muscle weakness. *FKTN* has been reported in association with autosomal recessive myopathy caused by variation in FKTN as early as 1998 by Kobayahsi et al (PMID: 9690476).\n\nOMIM entities: Cardiomyopathy, dilated, 1X, (MIM# 611615); Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (congenital with brain and eye anomalies), type A, 4 (MIM# 253800); Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (congenital without mental retardation), type B, 4 (MIM# 613152); Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (limb-girdle), type C, 4 (MIM# 611588).\n \nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) AND inheritance pattern AND phenotypic variability in the above mentioned disease entities. Therefore, all of the disease entities were originally lumped into one disease entity, “myopathy caused by variation in FKTN”.  In order to improve the consistency of the nomenclature relating to qualitative or quantitative defects of proteins involved in O-glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan and better represent the spectrum of phenotypes associated with variation in these genes,  the LGMD GCEP proposed the nomenclature revision: myopathy caused by variation in **gene**.\n \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 9 probands in 6 publications (PMID: 12601708, 19396839, 17036286, 9690476, 17044012, 14627679). The Japanese founder variant, a 3-kb retrotransposon insertion in the 3'UTR of *FKTN* is frequently reported and patients homozygous for this variant show a milder phenotype compared to patients compound heterozygous with a null variant (PMID: 9690476, 17036286). *FKTN* variants have also been identified in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and only mild or  subclinical skeletal muscle involvement (PMID: 17036286).  More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n \nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function. \n \nSummary of Experimental Data (6 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, expression studies, functional assays and rescue evidence. Fukutin is localized to the Golgi and has a role the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan in skeletal muscle and may be involved in brain development (PMID: 9690476, 21979053,  17034757). It is expressed in skeletal muscles, brain and retina (PMID: 9690476, 10852541). Fukutin interacts with other members involved in the process of dystroglycan glycosylation (PMID: 29477842, 17005282). Many model organisms have been developed including mouse and zebrafish models (PMID: 22922256, 19017726, 21317159) and rescue in mouse models and patient cells (PMID: 21979053) are also reported.\n \nIn summary, *FKTN* - myopathy caused by variation in FKTN gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was originally approved by the ClinGen Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP on July 1st, 2020 (SOP Version 7), but has since been updated to reflect SOP V9 (June 19, 2023). \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:54e23f1a-3b1b-49ef-aa02-6b46374b1546"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
