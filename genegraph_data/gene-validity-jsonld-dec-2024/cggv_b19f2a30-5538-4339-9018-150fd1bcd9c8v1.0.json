Syngap1 mutations disrupt developing pyramidal neurons, although it remains unclear if this process contributes to cognitive abnormalities. Here, we found that haploinsufficiency restricted to forebrain glutamatergic neurons was sufficient to disrupt cognition and removing mutations from this population prevented cognitive abnormalities. In contrast, manipulating Syngap1 function in GABAergic neurons had no effect on cognition, excitability, or neurotransmission, highlighting the specificity of Syngap1 mutations within forebrain excitatory neurons. Interestingly, cognitive abnormalities were reliably predicted by the emergence of enhanced excitatory synaptic function in mature superficial cortical pyramidal cells, which was a neurophysiological disruption caused by Syngap1 dysfunction in developing, but not adult, forebrain neurons. We conclude that reduced cognition in Syngap1 mutants is caused by isolated damage to developing forebrain glutamatergic neurons. This damage triggers secondary disruptions to synaptic homeostasis in mature cortical pyramidal cells, which perpetuates brain dysfunction into adulthood.","dc:creator":"Ozkan

At least 129 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel,\nnonsense, frameshift, large deletion, complex rearrangement, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. While a large number of pathogenic (mostly de novo) variants have been identified in patients with a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, there appears to be little correlation between variant location and severity of ID, epilepsy, or autism symptoms. In summary, SYNGAP1 is definitively associated with AD complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
