Its phenotype is characterized by axonemal abnormalities of respiratory cilia and sperm tails leading to bronchiectasis and sinusitis, which are sometimes associated with situs inversus (Kartagener syndrome) and male sterility. The main ciliary defect in PCD is an absence of dynein arms. We have isolated the first gene involved in PCD, using a candidate-gene approach developed on the basis of documented abnormalities of immotile strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which carry axonemal ultrastructural defects reminiscent of PCD. Taking advantage of the evolutionary conservation of genes encoding axonemal proteins, we have isolated a human sequence (DNAI1) related to IC78, a C. reinhardtii gene encoding a dynein intermediate chain in which mutations are associated with the absence of outer dynein arms. DNAI1 is highly expressed in trachea and testis and is composed of 20 exons located at 9p13-p21. Two loss-of-function mutations of DNAI1 have been identified in a patient with PCD characterized by immotile respiratory cilia lacking outer dynein arms. In addition, we excluded linkage between this gene and similar PCD phenotypes in five other affected families, providing a clear demonstration of locus heterogeneity. These data reveal the critical role of DNAI1 in the development of human axonemal structures and open up new means for identification of additional genes involved in related developmental defects.","dc:creator":"Pennarun G","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Loss-of-function mutations in a human gene related to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii dynein IC78 result in primary ciliary dyskinesia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:396be572-5b2c-4859-90dd-434a91c1ce96_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:679b1cf3-c508-4417-a022-fac06029c577_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:679b1cf3-c508-4417-a022-fac06029c577","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":12,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:45936e6d-21d5-4772-825b-859b68a927e6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012144.4(DNAI1):c.1212T>G (p.Tyr404Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/952542"}},{"id":"cggv:5d6f80e9-fdbd-405e-a079-2cb141f3ea7c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012144.4(DNAI1):c.1644G>A (p.Trp548Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5034487"}}],"detectionMethod":"The patient was genotyped by exon-capture and massively parallel sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000246","obo:HP_0200109","obo:HP_0033036","obo:HP_0002643","obo:HP_0000403"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Previous testing was limited to Sanger sequencing of the DNAI1 and DNAH5 loci.","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:0053132a-30cd-4e52-b95e-a35e38be8542_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:45936e6d-21d5-4772-825b-859b68a927e6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21270641","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Advances in genetic sequencing technology have the potential to enhance testing for genes associated with genetically heterogeneous clinical syndromes, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia.

Mutations in an intermediate chain dynein (DNAI1; IC78) have recently been described in PCD patients, with outer dynein arm (ODA) defects. The aims of the current study were to test for novel DNAI1 mutations in 13 PCD patients with ODA defects (from 7 unrelated families) and to assess genotype/phenotype correlations in patients and family members. A previously reported mutation (219+3insT) was detected in three PCD patients from two families. The opposite allele had the novel missense mutation G1874C (W568S) in both affected individuals from one family, and a nonsense mutation G1875A (W568X) in an affected individual from another family. The tryptophan at position 568 is a highly conserved residue in the WD-repeat region, and a mutation is predicted to lead to abnormal folding of the protein and loss of function. None of these mutations were found in 32 other PCD patients with miscellaneous ciliary defects. Mutations in DNAI1 are causative for PCD with ODA defects, and are likely the genetic origin of clinical disease in some PCD patients with ultrastructural defects in the ODA.","dc:creator":"Zariwala M","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Germline mutations in an intermediate chain dynein cause primary ciliary dyskinesia."}},{"id":"cggv:f54b0947-0e10-4183-a8ec-3e43cbc6dc23_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:936c4c89-7fb5-4e26-ae0e-838800fda03b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11713099"}],"rdfs:label":"Zariwala_2001_Family_16_Patient_II-2"},{"id":"cggv:f54b0947-0e10-4183-a8ec-3e43cbc6dc23","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f54b0947-0e10-4183-a8ec-3e43cbc6dc23_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:f54b0947-0e10-4183-a8ec-3e43cbc6dc23_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The NM_012144.4(DNAI1):c.48+2dup variant near the junction of exon 1 and intron 1 creates a cryptic splice donor site that triggers a 132bp in-frame insertion of sequence from intron 1 into the transcript (Fig. 7E in PMID: 10577904)."}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This variant has been up-scored due to evidence of gene impact at the mRNA level, but partially down-scored due to its identification as a high frequency founder variant (PMID: 16858015)."},{"id":"cggv:1c4f433b-10b1-4634-acc8-e738c9e16ce3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1c4f433b-10b1-4634-acc8-e738c9e16ce3_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"NM_012144.4(DNAI1):c.1704G>A (p.Trp568Ter) is a nonsense variant in exon 17 that is predicted to trigger nonsense-mediated decay or at least truncate the C-terminal 19% of the protein product.

There was relatively high percentage of DNAI and HYDIN mutations compared to other countries. The latter may be due to our solution for the problem of the confounding HYDIN2 pseudogene. Candidate genes included two recently published PCD-related genes DNAJB13 and PIH1D3; identification of the latter was a direct result of this study. In conclusion, we demonstrate 67.6% diagnostic yield by targeted exome sequencing in a Dutch PCD population and present a highly sensitive and moderately specific approach for identification of PCD-related genes, based on significant upregulation during in vitro ciliogenesis.","dc:creator":"Paff T","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Diagnostic yield of a targeted gene panel in primary ciliary dyskinesia patients."}},{"id":"cggv:baffc33b-cbaf-493c-b778-6754335fd0d5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:936c4c89-7fb5-4e26-ae0e-838800fda03b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29363216"}],"rdfs:label":"Paff_2018_Patient_PCD-8170"},{"id":"cggv:98b6c495-10fb-498f-92a9-2cb04e38d3e0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:98b6c495-10fb-498f-92a9-2cb04e38d3e0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The NM_012144.4(DNAI1):c.565_566del (p.Leu188_Thr189insTer)) variant is a frameshift variant in exon 5 of 20 that is predicted to trigger nonsense-mediated decay or at least truncate the C-terminal 73% of the protein product.

The similarity between the chains is greatest in their COOH-terminal halves; the NH(2)-terminal halves are highly divergent. The COOH-terminal half of IC78 contains six short imperfect repeats, termed WD repeats, that are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Although not previously reported, these repeated elements also are present in IC69 and IC74. Using the IC78 cDNA as a probe, we screened a group of slow-swimming insertional mutants and identified one which has a large insertion in the IC78 gene and seven in which the IC78 gene is completely deleted. Electron microscopy of three of these IC78 mutants revealed that each is missing the outer arm, indicating that IC78 is essential for arm assembly or attachment to the outer doublet. Restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping places the IC78 gene on the left arm of chromosome XII/XIII, at or near the mutation oda9, which also causes loss of the outer arm.

To develop a viable mouse model for long-term studies of PCD, we have generated a transgenic mouse line in which two conserved exons of the mouse intermediate dynein chain gene, Dnaic1, are flanked by loxP sites (Dnaic1(flox/flox)). Dnaic1 is the murine homolog of human DNAI1, which is mutated in approximately 10% of human PCD cases. These mice have been crossed with mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (CreER). Treatment of adult Dnaic1(flox/flox)/CreER(+/-) mice with tamoxifen results in an almost complete deletion of Dnaic1 with no evidence of hydrocephalus. Treated animals have reduced levels of full-length Dnaic1 mRNA, and electron micrographs of cilia demonstrate a loss of outer dynein arm structures. In treated Dnaic1(flox/flox)/CreER(+/-) animals, mucociliary clearance (MCC) was reduced over time. After approximately 3 months, no MCC was observed in the nasopharynx, whereas in the trachea, MCC was observed for up to 6 months, likely reflecting a difference in the turnover of ciliated cells in these tissues. All treated animals developed severe rhinosinusitis, demonstrating the importance of MCC to the health of the upper airways. However, no evidence of lung disease was observed up to 11 months after Dnaic1 deletion, suggesting that other mechanisms are able to compensate for the lack of MCC in the lower airways of mice. This model will be useful for the study of the pathogenesis and treatment of PCD.","dc:creator":"Ostrowski LE","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Conditional deletion of dnaic1 in a murine model of primary ciliary dyskinesia causes chronic rhinosinusitis."},"rdfs:label":"Dnaic1 inducible deletion mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The mouse model partially recapitulated the human patient phenotype at both the cellular and organ levels.

In this study, we showed the efficacy of Ion Torrent next generation sequencing for conducting genome-wide scans to map and identify a mutation causing congenital heart disease in a mouse mutant, Bishu, recovered from a mouse mutagenesis screen. The Bishu mutant line generated in a C57BL/6J (B6) background was intercrossed with another inbred strain, C57BL/10J (B10), and the resulting B6/B10 hybrid offspring were intercrossed to generate mutants used for the mapping analysis. For each mutant sample, a panel of 123 B6/B10 polymorphic SNPs distributed throughout the mouse genome was PCR amplified, bar coded, and then pooled to generate a single library used for Ion Torrent sequencing. Sequencing carried out using the 314 chip yielded >600,000 usable reads. These were aligned and mapped using a custom bioinformatics pipeline. Each SNP was sequenced to a depth >500×, allowing accurate automated calling of the B6/B10 genotypes. This analysis mapped the mutation in Bishu to an interval on the proximal region of mouse chromosome 4. This was confirmed by parallel capillary sequencing of the 123 polymorphic SNPs. Further analysis of genes in the map interval identified a splicing mutation in Dnaic1(c.204+1G>A), an intermediate chain dynein, as the disease causing mutation in Bishu. Overall, our experience shows Ion Torrent amplicon sequencing is high throughput and cost effective for conducting genome-wide mapping analysis and is easily scalable for other high volume genotyping analyses.","dc:creator":"Damerla RR","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Ion Torrent sequencing for conducting genome-wide scans for mutation mapping analysis."},"rdfs:label":"Bishu mouse harbors homozygous splicing variant in Dnaic1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"While these mice successfully model the human patient phenotype at the cellular and organismal levels, this evidence has been down-scored to avoid overlap with the previously scored mouse model from PMID: 19675306.

The specific disease entity, primary ciliary dyskinesia 1 (MONDO:0009484, OMIM #244400), is one of at least 45 different primary ciliary dyskinesias distinguished by a single monogenic cause. Affected patients can have onset of symptoms at birth but can also be diagnosed at least as late as during the 3rd decade of life (PMID: 11713099). Frequent features among well-characterized patients are neonatal respiratory distress, sinusitis, otitis media, bronchiectasis, and decreased nasal nitric oxide. Approximately 50% of cases exhibit situs inversus or another form of heterotaxy. Biopsies of the airway epithelium show ciliary ultrastructure with an absence of outer dynein arms and to a lesser degree absence of inner dynein arms. Cilia are largely or completely immotile. Adult patients can exhibit infertility.\n \nThis curation has scored thirteen suspected pathogenic *DNAI1* variants (three missense, three frameshift, four nonsense, and three disrupting splicing), which were collectively reported in thirteen probands in six publications (PMID: 10577904, PMID: 21143860, PMID: 16858015, PMID: 11713099, PMID: 21270641, PMID: 29363216). All of the probands harbored biallelic variants confirmed to be present in trans. No probands were reported to be from consanguineous parents, but two harbored *DNAI1* variants in the homozygous state, while the other eleven probands were compound heterozygous. The molecular mechanism appears to be biallelic loss-of-function with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, characterized in at least some cases by variants predicted to trigger the absence of a gene product. More genetic evidence was available (PMID: 11231901, PMID: 21143860, PMID: 16858015, PMID: 11713099) but was not included as the maximum for this category of evidence had already been reached. Large families with segregation data were not found for inclusion in this gene curation. Please note that the genetic evidence scored in this curation has relied heavily on the best-characterized *DNAI1* variants from the literature, while an urgent need remains for additional published data to evaluate the pathogenicity of many other emerging variants.\n \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence that high levels of *DNAI1* expression in humans are specific to tissues known to harbor multi-ciliated cells, particularly the testis, pituitary gland, fallopian tube, lung, and endocervix (PMID: 23715323). Biochemical studies of the *Chlamydomonas* ortholog of DNAI1 indicate that the protein product is an intermediate dynein chain positioned at the base of the alpha-beta dimer of the outer dynein arms (PMID: 2147183). Its direct interaction with alpha-tubulin (PMID: 1827120) indicates that it may function to link the outer dynein arms with axonemal microtubules, consistent with the ultrastructural defects characteristic of the human patients. The protein also interacts with the *Chlamydomonas* ortholog of DNAI2 (2147183), a related intermediate dynein chain that is associated in humans with primary ciliary dyskinesia 9. Human patient phenotypes such as ciliary immotility and absence of outer dynein arms are recapitulated by *Chlamydomonas* (PMID: 7698982) and other cellular models (PMID: 32823934) of DNAI1 loss of function. More complex patient phenotypes are recapitulated by a combination of conventional (PMID: 24306492) and conditional (PMID: 19675306) mouse models of *Dnai1* loss of function.\n \nIn summary, *DNAI1* is definitively associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on June 9th, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:396be572-5b2c-4859-90dd-434a91c1ce96"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
