Pathogenic variants in GTPBP2 were recently shown to be an ultra-rare cause of neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Until now, no human phenotype has been linked to GTPBP1. Here, we describe individuals carrying bi-allelic GTPBP1 variants that display an identical phenotype with GTPBP2 and characterize the overall spectrum of GTP-binding protein (1/2)-related disorders. In this study, 20 individuals from 16 families with distinct NDDs and syndromic facial features were investigated by whole-exome (WES) or whole-genome (WGS) sequencing. To assess the functional impact of the identified genetic variants, semi-quantitative PCR, western blot, and ribosome profiling assays were performed in fibroblasts from affected individuals. We also investigated the effect of reducing expression of CG2017, an ortholog of human GTPBP1/2, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Individuals with bi-allelic GTPBP1 or GTPBP2 variants presented with microcephaly, profound neurodevelopmental impairment, pathognomonic craniofacial features, and ectodermal defects. Abnormal vision and/or hearing, progressive spasticity, choreoathetoid movements, refractory epilepsy, and brain atrophy were part of the core phenotype of this syndrome. Cell line studies identified a loss-of-function (LoF) impact of the disease-associated variants but no significant abnormalities on ribosome profiling. Reduced expression of CG2017 isoforms was associated with locomotor impairment in Drosophila. In conclusion, bi-allelic GTPBP1 and GTPBP2 LoF variants cause an identical, distinct neurodevelopmental syndrome. Mutant CG2017 knockout flies display motor impairment, highlighting the conserved role for GTP-binding proteins in CNS development across species.","dc:creator":"Salpietro V","dc:date":"2024","dc:title":"Bi-allelic genetic variants in the translational GTPases GTPBP1 and GTPBP2 cause a distinct identical neurodevelopmental syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Salpietri 2024 Brain Expression Fig S5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c8e1f8d9-d8e8-428c-9860-f84bb96ff9ea_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dce8fd68-78b1-4988-9b0b-0f27be8bec93","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:955a6858-51ec-445a-90d8-953613129701","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Rescue of the cerebellar and retinal degeneration phenotypes was observed","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25061210","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"In higher eukaryotes, transfer RNAs (tRNAs) with the same anticodon are encoded by multiple nuclear genes, and little is known about how mutations in these genes affect translation and cellular homeostasis.

syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disease caused by pathogenic variants in GTPBP2. The core symptoms of this disease are intellectual disability, motor development delay, abnormal reflexes, skeletal abnormalities, and visual impairment. In this study, we describe a three-year-old girl with a novel homozygous variant in GTPBP2 and a phenotype overlapping with Jaberi-Elahi syndrome. This variant (NM_019096.5:c.1289T > C, p.Leu430Pro) was identified by Whole Exome Sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing although remains classified as VUS based on ACMG criteria. The proband demonstrated motor and intellectual developmental delay, muscle weakness, language disorder, facial dysmorphism, and poor growth. Hitherto, twenty-seven individuals with Jaberi-Elahi syndrome have been reported in the literature. This study, describes a review of the symptoms related to the Jaberi-Elahi syndrome. A large numbers of patients manifest motor development delay (26/28), sparse hair (26/28), and speech disorder (24/28). Moreover, a significant fraction of patients suffer from intellectual disability (23/28), hypotonia (23/28), skeletal problems (23/28), and visual impairment (18/28). In spite of previous patients, the proband in this study did not exhibit any skeletal abnormalities. In summary, we present evidence implicating a novel missense variant in Jaberi-Elahi syndrome, expanding and refining the genetic spectrum of this condition.","dc:creator":"Manoochehri J","dc:date":"2024","dc:title":"Jaberi-Elahi syndrome: Exploring a novel GTPBP2 mutation and a literature review."}},"rdfs:label":"Manoochehri 2024 Iranian Proband"},{"id":"cggv:06ca57ad-17f0-418d-a207-940cb4160079","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:06ca57ad-17f0-418d-a207-940cb4160079_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Deducting score due to homozygosity and consanguinity per SD GCEP Scoring Guidance Specifications"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:68d4c234-b50a-4f19-a489-f74176af4734_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:68d4c234-b50a-4f19-a489-f74176af4734","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:41388177-79de-47d3-8425-7c842ea9c50f"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:7e69acac-e373-47a2-a835-440704621ee0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:41388177-79de-47d3-8425-7c842ea9c50f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30790272"},"rdfs:label":"Family 2 Proband 2"},{"id":"cggv:7e69acac-e373-47a2-a835-440704621ee0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7e69acac-e373-47a2-a835-440704621ee0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Deducting half a point each for homozygosity and consanguinity per SD GCEP Scoring Guidance Specifications"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9051,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":16.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:4f1a9dcc-aa9d-488b-b9e4-fda202ef33a8","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0060711","gene":"hgnc:4670","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The *GTPBP2* (guanosine triphosphate binding protein 2) gene is located on chromosome 6 at 6p21 and encodes a member of the GTP-binding superfamily. This gene was first reported in connection with Jaberi-Elahi syndrome (JABELS) in 2016 (Jaberi et a., PMID: 26675814). This disorder is characterized by developmental, neurological (epilepsy, contractures and/or hypotonia), craniofacial (microcephaly and/or facial dysmorphism), skeletal (scoliosis or kyphoscoliosis), ectodermal (thin, sparse hair, eyebrows and/or abnormal dentition), and ocular features (retinal degeneration, cataract, and/or visual impairment). More recently, this condition has also been described as Gtpbp1/2-related ectodermal neurodevelopmental (GREND) syndrome) (Salpietro et al., 2024, PMID:38118446). Disease severity is highly variable. Some patients have social interaction and learn to walk but have an ataxic gait and abnormal movements, while others do not achieve any motor control, are non-ambulatory and nonverbal. Only the first reported family was found to have iron accumulation in the brain, but these individuals were clinically examined later in adulthood, while more recent reports were examined in childhood. It is possible that the iron accumulation brain phenotype is a later onset manifestation of disease. The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive; all but two of the reported affected families to date have been consanguineous. \n\nThe mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function, as most variants identified are truncations, frameshifts, or splice variants, though 5 missense variants have also been reported. At least eight unique variants (5 nonsense, 2 splice-site, 1 missense) that have been reported in eight probands from five publications (PMIDs: 26675814, 28454995, 29449720, 30790272, 38852771) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including a mouse model with a splice donor variant in intron 6 of gtpbp2 which recapitulates the cerebellar, retinal, and gait abnormalities found in humans (Ishimura et al., 2014, PMID: 25061210). Crossing mice with this variant to a different strain with gtpbp2 intact rescues the disease phenotypes. In addition, expression studies of human postmortem brain tissue show that *GTPBP2* is highly expressed in the brain regions disrupted in JABELS/GRENDS patients (Salpietro et al., 2024, PMID: 38118446).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *GTPBP2* and autosomal recessive JABELS/GREND syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date August 16th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c8e1f8d9-d8e8-428c-9860-f84bb96ff9ea"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
