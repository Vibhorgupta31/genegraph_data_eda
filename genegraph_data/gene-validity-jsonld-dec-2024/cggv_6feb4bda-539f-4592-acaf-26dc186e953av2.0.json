While other vitamin B(12) disorders are treatable with high dose cyanocobalamin (CNCbl) or hydroxocobalamin (OHCbl), cblC patients respond well to OHCbl but not to CNCbl. Patient mutations were introduced into recombinant MMACHC (cblC) protein and the binding of CNCbl and OHCbl was examined. Three mutations were analyzed: G147D, associated with early onset, vitamin B(12) unresponsive disease; R161Q, associated with late onset disease that is highly responsive to OHCbl; and H122A, selected to test the hypothesis that H122 is central to a proposed vitamin B(12) binding motif on MMACHC. We report here that wild-type MMACHC binds both OHCbl and CNCbl with similar, tight affinity (K(d)=5.7 microM). We also report that MMACHC binds CNCbl in the base-off form, with the dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) base of cobalamin displaced from coordination with the cobalt. In this form, wild-type MMACHC is able to reductively decyanate CNCbl to cob(II)alamin requiring only the presence of NADPH and FAD. We demonstrate that MMACHC with the G147D mutation is unable to bind either CNCbl or OHCbl, providing a straight forward explanation for the absence of response to either vitamin form. However, we show that MMACHC containing the R161Q mutation binds OHCbl with wild-type affinity, but is disturbed in binding CNCbl and has impaired decyanation. Finally, we show that H122A has reduced binding, but like R161Q, it binds OHCbl more tightly than CNCbl, suggesting that this histidine is not absolutely required for binding. These studies suggest that the ability of mutant MMACHC to respond to vitamin therapy depends on its ability to bind the vitamin with significant affinity, and for CNCbl, also on its ability to bind in the base-off form to facilitate reductive decyanation. These studies emphasize the continued use of OHCbl with cblC patients for maximum therapeutic effect.","dc:creator":"Froese DS","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mechanism of vitamin B12-responsiveness in cblC methylmalonic aciduria with homocystinuria."},"rdfs:label":"Cobalamin Binding"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Natural vitamin B12 is the hydroxyl form (OHCbl) but the generally available vitamin is a cyano derivative (CNCbl).

We studied 24 Italian and 17 Portuguese patients with cblC defect to illustrate the spectrum of mutations in a southern European population and discuss the impact that mutation identification has on routine diagnostic procedures. Since the metabolic defect raises the serum levels of homocysteine, we also tested if variants in MTHFR-playing a key role in homocysteine remethylation pathway-could act as genetic modifier in cblC defect. We found that the c.271dupA (accounting for 55% of the MMACH alleles in our cohort) followed by c.394C>T (16%) and c.331C>T (9%) were the most frequent mutations. In our study we also identified a novel mutation (c.544T>C).

This metabolic disease results in impaired intracellular synthesis of adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin, coenzymes for the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase enzymes, respectively. The inability to produce normal levels of these two coenzymes leads to increased concentrations of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine in plasma and urine, together with normal or decreased concentration of methionine in plasma. Here, we report a novel homozygous deletion mutation (NM_015506.2:c.392_394del) resulting in an in-frame deletion of amino acid Gln131 and late-onset disease in a 23-year-old male. The patient presented with sensory and motoric disabilities, urine and fecal incontinence, and light cognitive impairment. There was an excessive urinary excretion of methylmalonic acid and greatly elevated plasma homocysteine. The clinical symptoms and the laboratory abnormalities responded partly to treatment with hydroxycobalamin, folinic acid, methionine, and betaine. Studies on patient fibroblasts together with spectroscopic activity assays on recombinant MMACHC protein reveal that Gln131 is crucial in order to maintain enzyme activity. Furthermore, structural analyses show that Gln131 is one of only two residues making hydrogen bonds to the tail of cobalamin. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicates that the 3D structure of the deletion mutant is folded but perturbed compared to the wild-type protein.

PMID: 16311595). At least 93 unique variants (including many missense, nonsense, and small deletions or insertions, as well as some splicing variants) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 19 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 26149271, 28693988, 18164228, 16963011, 30157807, 16311595, 23580368). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by experimental evidence of the biochemical function, functional alteration in non-patient cells, rescue in patient cells, and a mouse model (PMIDs: 18779575, 19700356, 24889031, 16311595) . In summary, MMACHC is definitively associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type cblC. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6feb4bda-539f-4592-acaf-26dc186e953a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
