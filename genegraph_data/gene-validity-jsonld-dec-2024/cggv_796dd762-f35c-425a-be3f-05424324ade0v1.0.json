In a single large Australian family with an autosomal dominant form of nemaline myopathy, the disease is caused by a mutation in the alpha-tropomyosin gene TPM3. The typical form of nemaline myopathy is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, the locus of which we previously assigned to chromosome 2q21.2-q22. We show here that mutations in the nebulin gene located within this region are associated with the disease. The nebulin protein is a giant protein found in the thin filaments of striated muscle. A variety of nebulin isoforms are thought to contribute to the molecular diversity of Z discs. We have studied the 3' end of the 20. 8-kb cDNA encoding the Z disc part of the 800-kDa protein and describe six disease-associated mutations in patients from five families of different ethnic origins. In two families with consanguineous parents, the patients were homozygous for point mutations. In one family with nonconsanguineous parents, the affected siblings were compound heterozygotes for two different mutations, and in two further families with one detected mutation each, haplotypes are compatible with compound heterozygosity. Immunofluorescence studies with antibodies specific to the C-terminal region of nebulin indicate that the mutations may cause protein truncation possibly associated with loss of fiber-type diversity, which may be relevant to disease pathogenesis.","dc:creator":"Pelin K","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Mutations in the nebulin gene associated with autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10051637","rdfs:label":"2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Although this proband has one demonstrated variant, the paternal allele has no detected variant information available.

Different clinical-genetic entities have been characterized in the last few years, with implications for diagnostics and genetic counseling. Fifty percent of nemaline myopathy forms are due to NEB mutations, but genetic analysis of this large and complex gene by Sanger sequencing is time consuming and expensive. We selected 10 Italian patients with clinical and biopsy features suggestive for nemaline myopathy and negative for ACTA1, TPM2 and TPM3 mutations. We applied a targeted next-generation sequencing strategy designed to analyse NEB coding regions, the relative full introns and the promoter. We also evaluated copy number variations (by CGH array) and transcriptional changes by RNA Sanger sequencing, whenever possible. This combined strategy revealed 11 likely pathogenic variants in 8 of 10 patients. The molecular diagnosis was fully achieved in 3 of 8 patients, while only one heterozygous mutation was observed in 5 subjects. This approach revealed to be a fast and cost-effective way to analyse the large NEB gene in a small group of patients and might be promising for the detection of pathological variants of other genes featuring large coding regions and lacking mutational hotspots.

Accordingly, NEB and LMOD3 were reduced in skeletal muscle of both Klhl40-/- mice and KLHL40-deficient patients.

Nebulin mutations are the main cause of nemaline myopathy (NEM), with typical adult patients having low expression of nebulin, yet the roles of nebulin in adult muscle remain poorly understood. To establish nebulin's functional roles in adult muscle, we studied a novel conditional nebulin KO (Neb cKO) mouse model in which nebulin deletion was driven by the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promotor. Neb cKO mice are born with high nebulin levels in their skeletal muscles, but within weeks after birth nebulin expression rapidly falls to barely detectable levels Surprisingly, a large fraction of the mice survive to adulthood with low nebulin levels (<5% of control), contain nemaline rods and undergo fiber-type switching toward oxidative types. Nebulin deficiency causes a large deficit in specific force, and mechanistic studies provide evidence that a reduced fraction of force-generating cross-bridges and shortened thin filaments contribute to the force deficit. Muscles rich in glycolytic fibers upregulate proteolysis pathways (MuRF-1, Fbxo30/MUSA1, Gadd45a) and undergo hypotrophy with smaller cross-sectional areas (CSAs), worsening their force deficit. Muscles rich in oxidative fibers do not have smaller weights and can even have hypertrophy, offsetting their specific-force deficit. These studies reveal nebulin as critically important for force development and trophicity in adult muscle.

Variants in NEB were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1999 (Pelin et al. 1999, PMID: 10051637). At least 17 variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level\ndata and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 11 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 30517146, 10051637, 27105866). Of note is that all curated probands have at least one predicted null variant. Much more evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function, with the lack of actin organization contributing to skeletal muscle degradation and disorganization as well as the reduced contractile strength and calcium sensitivity causing muscle weakness and other related symptoms.\nThis gene-disease association is supported by two separate mouse models, each recapitulating the base phenotype of the disorder. There are several other pieces of functional evidence, most notably the interactions with KLHL40, the actin-binding function of the protein, expression primarily in the muscle, and cultured muscle fiber cells showing reduced contractile strength compared to controls. There is more experimental evidence available, but the maximum has been reached.\nIn summary, NEB is definitively associated with Autosomal Recessive Nemaline Myopathy 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
